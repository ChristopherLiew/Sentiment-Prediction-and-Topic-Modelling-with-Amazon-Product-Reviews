Awesome tablet. I was amazed how fast it is. And the software is very user friendly,1
"They don't last. USed in electronics (like computer mice, computer keyboards) Energizer or Duracell last easily 3x longer. Not worth the savings. If its going in some kids game or infrequent use (where the battery would be dead later anyways) ok.",-1
Thx.,1
kids love it EZ to use great Quality bought this for the grand kids had super reviews also free Amazon for a year 2 year warranty its the best buy out there,1
The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.,1
Long lasting product good bang for your buck.,1
We was looking for a easy tablet that has all the great features and functions that a young child can learn and grow with. I will be a great Christmas present.,1
The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.,1
"Great pad to give the little ones a headstart to the world of tech. Very sturdy cover, nice size for little hands to grip. Very reasonable price. Great buy !!",1
"Love the great deal on these batteries. Being a techie and a dad, I go through a lot of batteries in gadgets and toys. These perform well and were a great bargain. Will definitely keep these stocked up!",1
Seem to work just fine. Great price.,1
"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch.",1
Definitely enjoy using this at home. I was surprised at how intuitive it is and was able to answer any question in seconds. I mostly use it to play music through Amazon player. I know there's tons more it can do and can't wait to take advantage of all its capabilities.,1
"Batteries that work that are cheap! Boom, sold. Buy them now AND NEVER LOOK BACK.",1
I have a full load of batteries,1
"Great batteries, work as well and last as long as top name brands.",1
"This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend.",1
For a five year old this worked fine but was a bit slow loading games. But 5 year olds these days want it immediately. Like the kid friendly free books and games. It worked well with downloaded Disney movies and Netflix. May have to get one for 2 year old suster they both live it,0
These are great! They work well. A great price too!,1
"Best gift ever, now she leaves mom and dads phones/tablets alone and plays his own, which is also locked down as well. And thanks to the low price, I bought for his siblings as well, there is peace now",1
"I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He's never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won't admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials.",1
"I purchased this tablet because I wanted a bigger tablet. I also wanted an Amazon Fire and I got it at a great price, Right I basically use it for reading. I'm still learning the tablet. So far it's a really good tablet.",1
"Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2",1
"I bought 3 for my three granddaughters for Christmas. They love it. I love it too, free games, books, movies",1
This was a purchase for Christmas! Great tablet to surf the web or read books on! Would recommend for any age!,1
"I had an old one that lasted forever!! I finally dropped it and it broke (about the zillionth time it had been dropped, egad!). This new one is awesome just like the old one and I love that you can buy colors now! We got blue. My son is busy playing with Alexa, since she wasn't on our previous tablet. :)",1
This tablet has grt performance and good camera and long backup. 2 year warranty make lifw more easy for parent's.,1
"Pretty cool tablet for the price, pick it up when its on sale",1
Trying these batteries for the first time and with all the good reviews I am sure they will be fine,1
Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.,1
Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great.,1
Works just as well as the brand name batteries at a reasonable price.,1
I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.,-1
We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends,1
Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it.,1
This is my favorite kindle so far. The size is perfect and the weight is minimal. I love the fact it is back lit and I don't need a book light.,1
"My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7"" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled.",1
"I love this product , so nice to have for trips!!!",1
The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke,-1
We got this product for our 6 year old. I love the parental controls. Only downfalls I've noticed so far is it takes a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app. Wise on the parent login on this product.,1
This is a great product second one i purchase recomend it.,1
My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it,1
"My old kindle fire needed replacingLove my new one, great features, lightening fast, New size is easy on the eyes",1
These are working very well for us and they are economical to use-which we do a lot of.,1
"At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it..",1
good product,1
Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.,1
Item is as advertised,1
My son is 3 and he loves this tablet. It is very educational and worth the money,1
"The worst batteries that i have ever purchased. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Dont hold a charge for long and you have to buy Amazon's rechargeable pack. Doesnt work with otber brands but doesnt work with amazons either. I got this huge box and about 6 (yes, 6) actually recharge. Spend the money on duracell or energizer. I have a 4 pack of durcell with a charger and still works after years of recharging",-1
Work as well as name brand. Much cheaper!,1
Great purchase. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.,1
These batteries hold a charge well. I have used the generation of batteries before these (the green ones) for many years in my computer mouse and keyboard and my camera flash. I would image these would be as good or better.,1
Tablet is great! I bought it for my 6 year old daughter again (first one finally got the screen cracked) for Christmas and she and i love it. It has all the features you would expect from an android tablet but with nice parenting aspects to keep the kids where they should be.,1
Seemed to work just like any other batteries. My boys have had them running in their remote control cars for hours.,1
Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.,1
Good value at a very affordable price. Can't beat it.,1
"These seem as good as top-tier brands and models.Using these on professional audio equipment... the equipment ran the same amount of time.I think the only difference, is they are vastly less expensive.",1
Hardly last as long as a stick match. Total waste of money.,-1
satisfied,1
My husband loved his birthday gift. He is always on it. He uses the tablet instead of his phone.,1
Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use !,1
"I think my kids eat these or share them with friends because I fly through them. These work great, sure they aren't a top lithium brand or something but for most applications this is exactly what you need and in a quantity that works and ensures you have them on hand when you need them.",1
I find these batteries fail in a short time on items like wireless thermometers and wall clocks. On an average changing is required within a month. I would not purchase these again.,-1
Would recommend this to others better than kindle fires of best,1
These batteries are as good as any name brand,1
Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere,0
These are high quality batteries. We have been using them in multiple devices and they appear to function as well as any national brand.,1
"These batteries are junk. Some of the new once have no more power than the once they replaced. If they are good, they ware out very quickly. I don't like to make negative reports, but these are so bad!",-1
not the longest lasting batteries. but they're batteries... we've gone through the package really quickly.,0
Great batteries!,1
Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!,1
What a bargain for every day use. One has so many items that run on battery power and getting batteries by the box full is ideal. Thanks Amazon!,1
"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a tv remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are OK.",0
"lots of batteries, good price, seem to last as long as brand name",1
"I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the ""safe zone"". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program",1
These work really well and came in a very nice cardboard package. The organization of the cardboard package was much nicer than many of the plastic and cardboard packages batteries come in from the store. It was much easier to keep them all in the box (similar to a colored pencil box) than to try to shove them back in a half falling apart plastic package. They seem to work just as well as any storebrand batteries. I would definitely recommend these.,1
"Good batteries, they work as batteries should. They perform the function of a battery quite well.",1
"Good batteries just like you'd buy in a store, but these cost a lot less money!",1
"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!",-1
Great batteries for a great price. These are every bit as good as the major brands.,1
This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law.,1
"Between LeapPads, Xbox controllers and remotes, we use batteries a lot. These have held up great with a comparable lifespan to other household brands.",1
My Amazon insider suggested these. He made a great recommendation.,1
Nice reader. Light weight. Clear display! Portable,1
Great price,1
Great camera for a beginner very easy to understand,1
"I gave these battereis a perfect score because they look all right, but how can I know for sure I just got them.",1
I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.,1
Great batteries,1
This amazon tablet is perfect for first time users. Easy to operate even for a 3 year old.,1
"I bought these thinking, Great I can save some money!...... Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pics.(like energizer)...... Seriously, these batteries last me probably 2 hours when using them a lot...... Not kidding.....I will not repurchase these.......",-1
"Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard.",1
Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price,1
Bought for my granddaughter age 5 for Xmas. She loves it.,1
best battery value I have found.,1
Great batteries,1
This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. I like the Amazon exchange policy if it breaks.,1
Very good deal and quality!,1
Like how I was able to buy a version with more memory. Love this works great.,1
Fantastic buy and shipping was quick and easy.,1
"My 2 year old broke her email pro easily Being a toddler I wasn't surprised but email makes you buy a brand new one so I bought this instead. Nowe originally she had the 7 generation one and it was only 16 G and it ran out of battery in like 4.5 hours. The 8 generation 32 G allows ny 2 year old to download plenty but with parental controls I customized myself and for a long day at the RMV or doctor office or a drive 3vstates away, even if she takes a break I don't have to recharge it for more like 9 hours. This is with downloading and watching movies and full episodes if all her favorite b shows. Also she's crazy abusive with it and it functions perfectly. My 4 year old ha's it too and his preschool teachers are begging me to tell them how he's so quick to learn almost everything they put in front of him and his vocabulary has significantly improved as well. I'm so happy with it I'm going to buy one for myself as well as a back up incase one is stolen. Only issue is the kids get addicted so it's real important to b set the timer to shut the system down so they remember to take potty breaks and play outside, but other than that I am thrilled with this product",1
"These batteries are awful, have no power and die fast",-1
I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.,1
"I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I've had none of the issues I've experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music.",1
Cheap reliable batteries!,1
"Nothing bad to say about the Kindle. I knew what I was getting when I got it, and it hasn't disappointed.",1
"The grandkids love this tablet, easy for them to use",1
Bought for the grandkids and they work great might get one for myself,1
"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad.",-1
These batteries work as I expected.,1
Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.,1
The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls,1
died quick,-1
"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great.",1
This is for my 5 year old and she hasn't put it down since Christmas. She uses it for watching videos and taking pictures of her toys..,1
I brought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She is able to download all of her games and apps that she uses to have on the iPad.,1
Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket,1
"Good bargain, great price and last as long as brand name batteries.",1
Bought this for my three year old when I bought a new car with no tv in it. She loves that I can download shows and movies and then watch others on wifi.,1
I got this for my 3 year old after he broke my tablet. It is perfect for him! I love that it comes with all the games and apps. He has dropped it several times and no issues.,1
Bought this for my grandson and am very pleased with the quality. The case protects it well.,1
it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.,1
Great buy!,1
"Great pricing, batteries seem to hold up well!",1
good batteries at a good price,1
Such a great value!!!,1
A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.,1
I'm shocked at how long these cheap batteries last (mainly in LED candles). Great for items that don't use a lot of energy.,1
For the price you can't go wrong and I feel they last as long as the name brand.,1
"Some work, some don't.",0
It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present,1
This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.,1
I bought this tablet to use with my 3 year old autistic son. I tried 3 different tablets and all 3 were defective. It would turn off by itself during a video. We were using It for his therapy sessions and this was very inconvient. Switched to a 7 and have had no trouble since.,0
"Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you're holding it.",1
great deal!!,1
"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad",1
These truly are long lasting I'd had them in my game remote and they last longer than the name brand definitely would repurchase,1
suggested by the sales associate I'm glad I took his suggestion,1
Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school,1
"I like that it is not linked to google, this tablet has better parental controls,and its perfect for little ones the case is a awesome bonus also.",1
"Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet.",1
"Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it.",1
"This tablet is excellent! I'm able to download books, watch hulu and Netflix, as well as play games. Overall a wonderful product!",1
They work pretty well so far :-) great price!,1
"great price, very good batteries",1
great deal on batteries that work well.,1
Great product got it for a good price would recommend it,1
"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk.",1
"Initial charge upon receipt was higher than the name brand batteries I usually get, I'll definitely be ordering more when these are about gone!",1
Good batteries for a good price.,1
amazon branded products are usually very good.,1
"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels",1
Internet usage is restricted. I returned it for a regular Kindle Fire and bought the kids case and Geek Squad protection plan instead.,1
Was ok till it fell off table landed flat face down the broke screen my granddaughter threw unit and didn't break but it fell then broke so what good is bumper on unit if that happens,1
Good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn,1
Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.,1
great,1
Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.,1
I wish I would have bought this version earlier! Love the free play option as well.,1
"VERY parent friendly! Extremely thorough parental controls. We were told at the store there was no way to block internet or control other content on a tablet, so we decided not to get one. Then, we read about the integrated parental controls with the Fire and gave it a try. It allowed us to do everything we wanted and more. Also, very easy set up and use!",1
"Got on a good deal, lasts as long as the name brands.",1
Amazon Basics - you are my hero. These are great batteries. I use them in my Apple keyboard and mouse and they have outlasted the brandname batteries I used to use. I get on average an additional 1-2 weeks of use out of each set of batteries which is an additional money saver. The shelf life seems to be normal for alkaline batteries.The packaging is biodegradable which adds to the convenience and value.,1
"The Unit had good screen resolution and the size was not bad but, Not at all impressed with the Amazon operating system.",-1
my 6 year old has not put this down!! It is easy to use and she loves the games that are already preinstalled!,1
Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun,1
Easy to set up. Durable for toddlers. Highly recommend.,1
This is great product. The tablet are made tough and great price.,1
We've had this tablet for about a month and have no complaints. Great tablet for a kid with lots of storage for games!,1
Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader,1
Great tablet at a great price with the big screen Kids have no problem scrolling through it,1
I highly recommend this product for children with special needs,1
"I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I've enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas.",1
Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it,1
screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet,1
i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.,1
"Excellent, no dead batteires so far. Nice to have a big pack, wrapped by 6 so they are not all loose.",1
Good batteries for the price.,1
"Great Product, great price and fast shipping!",1
"I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market.",1
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.,1
I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it,1
"Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips",1
I'm planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!`,-1
Great tablet for those invested in the Amazon system. Nice screen and functions well.,1
Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it.,1
"My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price.",1
arrived and worked like a charm!!,1
Great,1
Exactly what you would expect. Very good price and nicely packaged.,1
They work!,1
Came as expected,1
Great buy,1
New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.,1
"I've become a big fan of the Amazon Basics line of batteries over the years. They work just as well as the name brands we're all familiar with and I have never run across any of the Amazon Basics batteries that were dead in the box. We seem to run through the AAA size in various remote controls like crazy around here, so buying them in the multi pack box is both convenient and a money saver.",1
"These are okay. I use them mostly in my Xbox controller, they runout pretty quick. They are fine but I am looking into getting a rechargeable battery pack for it because I hate having my controller die mid game.",0
"Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it.",1
great batteries great price,1
"did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying.",-1
Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain,1
"You may be locked into Fire OS, but for 90 of what you do on a tablet it is not a problem.",1
This product was exactly as promised. I was pleased with the price and would purchase these batteries again.,1
Batteries...what can you say,1
"If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets.",1
I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.,0
Got this as a gift for s friend that loves to read books! Very convenient and portable. Doesn't heat up to bad either.,1
Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.,0
It will make using tablet easier for first time users Transports well. Good value for the price,1
I recommend it for kids .great for find games easily.,1
outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2,1
Great Deal,1
Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!!,1
Seem to be long-lasting. Works just great.,1
I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.,1
Such a great deal for a LOT of batteries! It's always nice to have so many on hand. You never know when you're going to need them. Haven't noticed if the life is shorter than brand names. So far so good!,1
Needed them in a hurry - don't last that long.,0
This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.,1
Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.,1
"I bought this product back in September and have loved every moment of it. Setup was easy, the Amazon store and search bar make it easy to narrow down the thousands of books available, and the battery is long-lasting so that I don't have to worry about constantly charging. In 3 months I have only had to charge it twice. Best parts are the backlit screen with easy adjustment and ample storage!",1
We love the free time feature. Definitely going to end up subscribing after the free year trial is up. Our 2 year old loves it and we can control how long she's on it.,1
"I use hundreds of AAAs annually, and despite the graphics in ad, these are about the poorest performing, with least longevity, of any I have bought. Still have another 100 of these, but will likely go thru those quickly.",-1
Only time will tell if they leak like some many Duracells or Kirkland brand.,1
Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.,1
Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders,1
"Nice, reasonable price.",1
Awesome product. Enjoy using it everyday. Would definitely recommend,1
This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.,-1
"I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! I love the user friendly parental controls!",1
These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.,-1
this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally.,1
"I got this tablet for my 6 year old grand daughter and I must say it was a great decision. She used her tablet for learning and fun. I watch her play her games on her tablet, listen to her favorite music and watch her movies. She has no problem using her tablet, she has even taught me how to operate her Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet",1
The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.,0
"Two batteries came with my amazon basics mouse i bought. I was suprised that it took two years for them to die. Definitely buying again, highly recommend.",1
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value.,1
"Great for the kids, and has a good battery for how much they use it",1
I bought this tab for my 5 years old kid.The tab is excellent and my son liked it very much.,1
delivered on time.,1
Great product. Updating a old fire. Would recommend to a friend,1
The device is built for children. Touch screen is amazing.,1
My daughter loves it. She uses it consistently and her brother has expressed an interest in having his own,1
"This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends.",1
Work better than most. Very happy with this purchase.,1
I bought this for my two year old grandson but the restrictions were too much.,0
This was to replace an earlier gen Kindle. That one would just shut down. We have not had any concerns with this and I will say I like the design better.,1
Great functionality and quality for the price. I've bought several of these for customer giveaways and have yet to hear a complaint!,1
"The best device for a child in the market. Purchased for an infant and after two weeks, he is loving it. Easy to handle and durable.",1
My grandson love this tablet alot of great games and learning activities.,1
Just as good as the store bought batteries BUT at a more reasonable price!,1
We bought this for our three year old son. He loves it. Plus it has many options for us to keep him from seeing things he shouldn't. The layout is really simple also making it great for children or adults!,1
"Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend",1
Great Product and Price,1
"Bought this for my boyfriend, he LOVES it! He takes it on every trip we go on. It's so powerful for such a small speaker! I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",1
Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!,1
"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",1
"Nice, eco-packaging, arrived so fast, and a great price. So far so good with the battery life.",1
A good choice for younger children. I bought for a 4 year old to replace a Nabi. However it doesn't have as many app choices as an Android device,1
I like how easy and fast it is to order these batteries. This is a really good price for the convenience aspect.,1
i liked t because its not harmful to my eye like the monitor or the mobile its the best choice for reading,1
They are batteries. They work.,1
It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift.,1
"So far, these Amazon AA batteries do as well as any others that I have used. Having a bunch of these insures that the many items needing AA batteries will always be usable AND they are mush less expensive then the little 4 packs you would purchase in any store.",1
Absolute best for kids. Bought three for ages toddler to teen and it's perfect for each.,1
Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.,1
GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.,1
pretty good batteries ---------would recommend energizer or duracell morethese batteries wear out quicker than others I've noticed,1
Had to have my son set up the tablet took about 30 mins,1
The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.,0
This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast,1
I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.,1
"Great product I use at night to watch shows on, play games and listen to music.",1
It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.,1
This is a great gift has every thing you need to have fun,1
Great product would recommend it this to others. Have a great picture.,1
I put several of these in my mouse battery and had to replace them after only a few days. Will not be buying more.,-1
"I love having a box of these. They are packed in bundles of 4. This makes them a lot less mess. They seem to last just as long as other big name brands, and are cheaper. They are in the drawer, with a box of AA and 9v. All in their own boxes and easy to grab and get some out. No more ziplock bag full of random batteries.",1
Cheap batteries are good batteries when you have kids,1
works great,1
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use.,1
"Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps,",1
My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages.,1
Great product and reasonable price! Suitable for everyday use,1
Great to have a good supply of batteries that come in a good storage case.,1
I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!,1
Batteries,1
I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.,1
Cheap long lasting batteries.,1
Good price works great would buy again good value for the price,1
Thanks children are help but changed don't work good.,1
"I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page.",1
Who would have thought amazon batteries could compete with the other top brands. They definitely serve their purpose and I will buy again.,1
"Excellent, exactly as described",1
"features are similar to my fire 6 and this upgrade is good. I wish it was lighter in weight, although I enjoy the larger screen.",1
"Sturdy construction, withstands toddlers use or (abuse)",1
not the best batteries,1
It goes off in week.,-1
works ok,1
"Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows.",-1
I can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them.,1
Great steelbook for a great movie. this steelbook is amazing,1
This Kindle is amazing for children and tweens. Its sturdy and light and fun to use.,1
Great product and works great.,1
"Great device with more space than previous models. Screen is brilliant and memory is expandable now. Oh yea, and my daughter loves it.",1
"Gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera",1
"I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me.",-1
ive not had any problame with these batteries have ordered them in the past been very pleased.,1
My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos,1
Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.,1
This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.,1
It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.,-1
Alexa works best on this device. Even it doesn't run full android system but its good enough for my need. Both pleasure and a bit of work sometimes. Cant beat that price,1
"Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew. Such a great price, he only wants to play games on it. His brother broke his original tablet, so this repaved it. He's happy! I also bought me one!",1
Cant go wrone with affordable batteries.,1
Works great. Easy to use. Fast. Great for the whole family.,1
My granddaughter loves it. She is disabled and is actually learning her site words from school from the books app. Being ADHD she can sit for along time playing. Love that it is geared for kids.,1
This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.,1
Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!,1
Great for kids! Very good size and light. Kids love it.,1
Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.,1
excellent for kids and safe cover so if dropped it survives,1
they're batteries,1
Switched form Costco batteries to these Amazon battery. AA and AAA are great. Unfortunately 9V is off from the standard size.,1
the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire,1
My son loves his tablet. It is very easy to use. Very stutdy.,1
Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it,1
Best gift ever for my granddaughter. She loves it .,1
Last just as long as any named brand.,1
Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.,0
Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.,1
Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer.,1
"Great toy for a 6 years old nephew, which was the reason why I buy this tablet. Had all need it for hours of entertainment for my nephew, I download a few games and load a couple of movies, the performance was great but then I found a couple of issues.First, I was unable to directly download any app from the tablet, receive a constant error saying than I need to activate ONE-CLICK DOWNLOAD, I follow all instructions and had to create a virtual credit card (I never insert my real credit card on a 6y/o toy, never), even if my intentions was only download free apps. Nothing works, change the address, change the credit card, try everything and nothing works. Finally I found a bypass method which is use my browser on my pc, connect to the amazon account and link the tablet, then I was able to install new apps.The second issue was to discover than the tablet can be only use on US, my surprise when I try to add more apps when I travel outside US and after hours of trying, found the answer on a forum when indicate than the tablet was created to be use on on US.",0
So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too.,1
What a deal on great Batteries!! Thanks Amazon!,1
"Reader works well in good light, convenient and useful if you like to read",1
"Great batteries, great price.minor side note- batteries are actually silver, not white as they look in the picture",1
Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it! Has so many apps I can download that he loves.,1
"This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there.",0
"Like most people I use tons of batteries. The super high price and hassle of the marketing and nomenclature of buying them at the store is removed by buying these Amazon battery packs. More and more I am realizing that when possible it's a good idea to go with the 'Amazon Basics' products (especially for items like batteries). Certainly there are premium batteries that I have trusted for years and will continue to purchase. But I have found no difference between these Amazon batteries and my favorite other brands. So instead of buying 2 or 5 packs of batteries while waiting to check out in the store think about getting a realistic quantity of excellent batteries for half the price (maybe not half, but certainly less than name brands).",1
"This is a great tablet for my 3 year old grandson. The cover is great in that, if he drops it, it won't break! Great buy",1
"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price.",1
"The Kindle Fire works well and I enjoy reading on it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems silly to restrict people from reading Nook books on it just because it is a different platform. As a book lover, I like supporting bookstores not only the almighty Amazon. Yes, I know there are ways to get around the restriction. The reason to reduce a point is not based on the excellence of this Kindle, but on politics of sharing.",1
this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .,1
"Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player.",1
"The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video.",1
I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.,1
my 9 yr old loves her new tablet . she had a nabi and likes this better,1
Seem good quality. Will update after seeing how they last.,1
"Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store.",0
"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Barring that, enjoy!",1
"After owning the kids Samsung, this seems confusing to navigate. Also they have returned to using the Samaumg",-1
Good batteries. No problems found,1
Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.,1
"I really like it, it's working out quite well for me wish I had bought one a lot sooner",1
"Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far.",1
Purchase this Amazon - Fire HD 8 Kids Edition for my 2 year old grand daughter. She can watch her kid's videos now on her own device. She is learning to pick the videos she wants to watch. Her parents love it as well. Now it frees up their smart phones for their use.,1
I would recommend this tablet because of the value,1
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!,1
My family goes through a lot of AA and AAA batteries. I've been buying bulk packs of AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline Batteries for a few years now and my household expenditures on batteries have gone down by nearly half. I don't see any difference in the overall performance or life of these batteries when compared to Duracell or EverReady alkaline batteries and they cost quite a bit less.,1
"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",1
Great price. Packed in 4's.,1
"Excellent quality, long lasting - so far so good.",1
Very easy to use by a 2 year old. Love how I can limit the time use.,1
"This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting",0
Got this for my daughter. I absolutely love the parental control.,1
Great price and works fantastic,1
"This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners.",1
ƒ∞t is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs,1
Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.,1
I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends,1
Work like they should,1
"Awesome value for the price! I haven't had a single problem with these batteries and I've used them in remotes, cameras, toys, all kinds of stuff. I'll never buy batteries from the store again!",1
I am disappointed in length of battery life.,0
I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!!,1
These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I've used! I should send back..,-1
"Best bang for buck on batteries, and always good to have a small stock of them on hand for whatever you might need.split this with my roommate, and so we now each have some AAA and we also split a pack of AA, great for the controllers that dont get used regularly, toys, remotes, whatever, if you plan ahead, it is worth it.",1
Very good.,1
Great batteries for the price.,1
"I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this",1
"Great apps, excellent price, my kids really enjoy it",1
The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?,1
My four year old love it. It‚Äôs like Theon his own world,1
"Another great product from amazon. I also use their rechargeable AA batteries which last a lot longer than any Energizer or Duracell that I have ever used. When it comes to any common battery size (AA, AAA, C, D, etc.), I will only be using AmazonBasics. Give this product a try and you won't be disappointed. You can't beat the price and/or quality.",1
"My 3 year old is learning so much playing the games on this tablet, and I love that it is so durable and can take a beating. Would recommend. Many games to match many age groups. Plus YouTube access.",1
"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR",1
Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........,0
Sales people were helpful controller cable should be longer,1
So far I love it very good price and all the batteries are fully charged :) (I checked!) I also love the package that it was in. I'm using it as storage for these batteries right now very useful. I guess all I'm saying everything that comes with this are useful :),1
This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.,1
Tablet is for my 2 year old son and it has great learning game so for him! He's learning to read and so much more!,1
"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too.",1
It would have been nice if the charging cord was more compatible with other devices.,1
I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen.,1
Purchased for my son for fun use as well as school. Works great!,1
we bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them these are the best tablets on the market they have great learning apps on them aswell,1
These batteries are long lasting.,1
"These batteries are a really great buy, same quality as the name brand batteries at a much better price",1
My son loves his tablet. He proudly proclaims to everyone he meets to check out his cool tablet. He especially loves the Freetime app.,1
"These test full charge while the ones i have been buying are already partially discharged bc u cannot tell how fresh they r, even when they are adv as good for 10 yrs.",1
"My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix.",1
"Boxed well, easy to set up, and pretty easy to get the hang of.",1
Great for kids its durable and lets them play games etc.. so they leave our cell phones alone LOL,1
okay,0
work but short life,-1
I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.,1
Great price - would give 5 but haven't used them enough.,1
I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and I had.,1
"Great price, they work fine",1
This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children.,1
Awesome good size large enough for games and photos,1
We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value!,1
I am very impressed with this tablet. It is faster than some iPads I have used. I gave this as a gift and my Mother-in-law loves it. Thank you,1
I loved it. I purchased it for my daughter. We got a free year subscription which came with a lot of apps to keep her engaged.,1
"I love Amazon Basics batteries! They cost less than even the cheapest batteries from the dollar store, but they work just as well as the name brands. Best of all, I don't even have to get in my car to purchase them. I always keep plenty of these in my house since my kids' toys just eat up batteries!",1
I bought this Amazon Fire HD Tablet for my 3 yr. old grandson for Christmas. It has been keeping him occupied with so many educational activities and games!,1
"Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use.",1
Love the packaging. Very happy with my purchase.,1
I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed.,1
This was a great buy. The price is unbelievable for 48 batteries.,1
Great for kids! It's very easy for them to navigate.,1
I like them and they are easy to use and my son love it,1
Very easy to use. Trying to motivate my son to read more. So far is working.,1
Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.,0
Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...,1
Growing up I didn't have electronics but this thing is awesome for kids. You can limit usage and break down how much time they can spend doing certain things. Great buy,1
"I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music.",1
"For the price you can't beat this little tablet, it does an awesome job!",1
"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead",-1
GREAT,1
"Working efficiently, no complaints so far. Makes reading fun!",1
Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet.,1
Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!,1
Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.,1
Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday,1
Can skip from one app to another with ease love it,1
"Good bargain, great price and last as long as brand name batteries.",1
Very sturdy for little people who might drop it easy to read,1
My husband is up in years & really enjoys spending time on his Kindle. He had a smaller one & it gave out on him so this one is ideal. He spends hours on it & has hours of fun!!!,1
Hi folks... these are just good all around batteries. Used them for years.,1
This is my go to for all my battery needs.,1
"the screen flush with the sides is great. The glass feeling is really nice. I don't use the side buttons for page turning but only because of habit. They are great and the need for pressure allows me to hold the kindle without changing pages. But, the price is painful. It is a splurge purchase since the paperwhite is just about as good in nearly every respect.",1
Got this for my teenage son (17) so that he could give his eyes and neck a rest from looking at media on his iPhone 7+ He totally loved it!,1
they seem to wear out really fast,-1
Fast delivery. Good value!,1
I'm always satisfied with these batteries,1
Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.,1
It's so easy to use and fun! I watch shows on Netflix and MTV apps,1
I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.,1
Decent price for the grand kid's toys. Last a good time.,1
"I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase.",1
"Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on.",-1
"Fully functional and seem to keep charge as well as one would hope batteries would. They came in a brown cardboard box which was actually really helpful for storing, and removing a couple without having batteries go everywhere.",1
Perfect!,1
They're cheap for a reason - they don't last nearly as long as Energizer or Duracell's from what I've noticed.,0
"I primarily use these for my noise cancelling headphones and wireless mouse. Overall, for the price, this is an okay product. I do not get the longevity I received when buying other brands, but for the price and quantity it seems to all equal out. I would not recommend using them for vital devices nor rely on them in emergencies.",0
This is a great tablet. Power connector could be better.,1
Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news.,1
Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all!,1
"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible.",0
"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!",1
Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.,1
"They're batteries, what's not to love",1
This is good,1
Excellent little tablet for reading books when you're on the go.,1
I bought these tablets for my niece and nephew who are only 2 and 3 and they love it. My niece who's only 3 has shown my mother a few things. Great products,1
I received this as a gift. One of the best I've ever received.,1
"Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality",1
So far so good....work as well as brand name batteries and cost much less,1
"they're batteries. nothing special to say, as they worked as they were supposed to : )",1
"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment.",0
"I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough.",1
"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing.",1
These Amazon Basic batteries are just as good as the expensive name brand. I'll be buying these from now on.,1
Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.,1
Nice quality and good duration. And it's a great value. Plus it's a huge pack so hopefully I won't run out for a while.,1
"Bought this for my 3rd grader when her school suggested to parents to get a tablet, they use them occasionally in school. This inexpensive one fits the bill just fine.",1
Good batteries,1
"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice.",0
"Having looked elsewhere for this product and found them really expensive, found this on Amazon at a fantastic price and was really pleased with it.",1
Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all,1
Grandkids each got one and they love it. Step up from original Kindle.,1
Amazon Basics. That's all that needs to be said:),1
"A lot of batteries for a great price, i bet you will never see that at a supermarket! Thank you AmazonBasics!",1
"Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned....",1
"A great deal, and the batteries have a good life to them. I will buy again when I start running low.",1
hey there batteries,1
Good,1
Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.,1
Nothing further to Comment. Giving as a Xmas gift.,1
My kids love the product. Really durable after drops.,1
Good performance. Good price.,1
"Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken.",1
Bought it as a Christmas present based on input from a friend of mine,1
Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs,1
"This tablet is great, and it has a good battery life. I'd recommend for people who love to read.",1
"Cheap AAA batteries! Haven't had any issue with them so far, I use them in stuff like... my nose hair trimmer.",1
I am a professional photographer and have these as backup for flash. kids steal them for their gaming.. they work and last the same as every name brand.,1
my son loves his tablet! best if you buy some amazon gift credit for some games and apps.,1
Great packaging - nice little card board box to store the batteries in. Beats the packs batteries usually come in.,1
I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought.,1
They're just batteries like advertised,0
Great,1
"if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space",1
"Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased.",1
Bought this product for a friend and she loves it. I plan to buy myself one now.,1
Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead.,1
A lot of batteries for the price. Solid deal.,1
The Tap is a great companion to your every day business. It has become my partner in my daily communications.,1
"Worked as expected, great pricing, simple packaging.",1
Great bang for your buck!,1
"I am a big fan of Amazon batteries! They cost less, last as long, and get here in 2 days with Prime!",1
"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",1
"My wife purchased this for my daughter , great for learning to read.",1
I love the Voyage. The display is clean and crisp and I have found the auto adjusting lighting to work perfectly for me. I love the side page turning buttons. I no longer have to use two hands to read a book anymore.,1
"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids.",1
"This is an awesome product.I also own a paperwhite, if you always read in good lighting I would recommend you save some money and buy this instead of the paperwhite.",1
I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card.,1
My kids love their kindles and love free time in it. Numerous educational games!,1
"I mostly use my laptop on my lap. Go figure. I have a 17 inch laptop and have tired a few other portable laptop holders, all plastic, and they have all broken with in a couple of months. This one is metal but still lightweight. It also has the added value of having a flat, perforated base which makes it more comfortable in my lap and it gives me a place to place peripherals such as external hard drives. I am very happy with this product and recommend it.",1
"Great value. I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old so I needed a tablet that was indestructible. This tablet is extremely durable, fairly quick and the 1 year of Amazon Freetime is nice. You cannot break this tablet especially with the thick foam case that comes with it. If you want a tablet for your little ones that is indestructible, affordable, educational and has great parental features then this is what you are looking for. The only downside is the screen brightness could be a lot brighter.",1
"Bought for my daughter. Has everything she needs, great value",1
Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use.,1
"Got this for my wife for Christmas, wasn't sure she would use it. Turned out to be a great gift. Perfect for email, facebook with the Kids, get's her bookclub book delivered instantly from Amazon. And good battery life with a sharp picture.",1
Wonderful gift for my niece.She gets entertainment and also gets to use it to learn things.,1
Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal,1
Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books.,1
Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too.,1
It makes reading at night much easier. Easy access to books that are of interest.,1
"Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job.",1
It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!,1
Love them,1
Works just fine in my Xbox One controller. I replaced the batteries a few weeks ago and they're still fine.,1
It is easy for little ones to use. Great beginner buy.,1
my 2 almost 3 year old son for Christmas it is great even for adults as well very sturdy and holds but to a wild 2 year old,1
Don't waste your coin of the expensive store brands. These work great.,1
Great item for the price and found they last just as long as top named batteries out there. Can never have too many spare batteries around in case of emergency.,1
"Easy decision, the amazon basics line of products has always worked well for me, and amazon customer service on their stuff is amazing if you need it.There is little difference in Alkaline batteries. (Costco hits top rank in consumer reports, but I have not seen their amazon battery rating.)But ordering from amazon is so easy, and the quality is good",1
I have no qualms about the quality of these batteries.I only wish that every 4 batteries were not individually wrapped.,1
I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money,1
"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option",0
No issues thus far. I just started using them so I speak for their longevity.,1
Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others,-1
Bought these for my grand children for Christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their 'tablets' and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet.,1
"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine",1
"Gave these batteries a shot, because we've had great luck with AmazonBasics products. I just purchased the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. These batteries do not last. I have a flashlight that uses 4 AAA batteries, and have gone through 8 batteries in a one week span. These die very quickly. I have had a similar experience with the AA batteries on a wireless Mac keyboard. Would not recommend these batteries.",-1
"This was a nice purchase for my son 8yr old, it performs well",0
love the 4-pack packaging prevents short circuits!,1
"long lasting and great price, I have two grandkids who are gamers and these are perfect",1
delivered as promised,1
Great price! Great product! Haven't noticed any difference from other name brand alkaline batteries. I will definitely buy this again.,1
Great product. Fast shipping!,1
"I bought the Fire HD 8 after having earlier bought one for another grand child. They loved it's ease of use, and the large selection of games and shows available. I will be buying another one for my third grand child in May.",1
"I buy AAA and AA batteries about 4 - 6 times a year. I made the switch to Amazon batteries about 2 years ago and never looked back. These batteries work just as well as any of the name brands, but at a much more reasonable cost.",1
I love EVERYTHING about our tablets. We haven't put them done since purchasing them.,1
The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.,-1
"I love it!! It can do it all!! Beautiful color graphics and in no time at all, I can watch a movie or play games or read my favorite novel. I love it!!",1
"My soon to be wife and I decided to buy the tablet for our nephew for his birthday and he's in love with it. He's able to watch youtube and play games on it, doesn't hiccup or lag at all. A huge plus for me is the protective case it came with. With it being on sale at the time for around $100 for a 32GB tablet - that was a no brainer. Definitely worth every penny.",1
"Great price, arrived quickly, and last just as long as any of the name brand batteries we have used in the past!",1
"This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point.",1
This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.,1
"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her.",1
Recommended by Gina.,1
Don't last very long,-1
Bought them for the grand kids toys at Christmas and they work fine but that's all I can tell you because it's only been 8 hours.,1
"The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started.",1
"Although this tablet is not really for everyday normal use due to some of its limitations, I was looking for a good replacement for a very old ipad that was slowing down. Picked this up for less than 40 dollars and really can't complain considering my last ipad was over 500. Good starting tablet or for those that do not need much,",1
"My two year old learned how to operate my smart phone so I decided to get her a tablet. After looking at various toy and educational versions, this seemed like the best choice. The preloaded apps are fun and educational. The ability to set daily time limits is great as I didn't want this to becoming a replacement for playing outside or an instant babysitter. Also the ability to switch profiles and operate like any other kindle fire is nice for when my wife wants to read. Great deal with a good manufacturer warranty. Very pleased with it.",1
I purchased this Fire Tablet as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is learning to use it and so far likes it really well. He hasn't downloaded any books yet but he now has an email address and will soon have a Facebook account. His brothers & sisters live around the country so now he will be able to keep in contact with them.,1
Batteries are great.....I need them for my work for my camera for taking pictures on the job of properties. Nice to have extras on hand at an affordable price. I don't see that they last any less time than the name brand batteries.,0
Work just as well as other but cheapeR!,1
The is an entry level tablet for those who are looking for a budget tablet. I believe you can only access to Amazon App Store - which has fewer apps as compared to Apple Store and Google Play.,1
They work what else can I say. Thank you.,1
Great,1
Previously purchased and used these batteries. They last longer than other store brand. Worth the money.,1
I bought this Tablet for my Wife. She uses it every day. It is very usefulto her. She uses it in place of a computer. She watches movies on it.The Graphics are excellent.,1
"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain.",1
Wanted to upgrade my grandaughter's kindle. I know she will enjoy it as much as her previous one.,1
works great!!!!!,1
"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased.",1
"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience.",1
"I was previously buying batteries at dollar tree, 4 at time. This will not only save me time, but money and they're great quality for the price! As soon as I opened, I put them to use for my Xbox one wireless controller to try them out and they have lasted much longer than the batteries I was using before.",1
This device provides necessary app and is extremely user friendly.,1
these are great,1
"I waited for weeks to get this new model and am happy I did. I love the new features on the Kindle Voyage. Didn't give it 5 stars due to some difficulty with the pressure sensitive buttons. I don't know if it is a flaw with the design or operator error, but sometimes it is more challenging than I think it should be to get the page to turn. It is far easier to swipe the screen so this is what I typically do. But, regardless. . . I love the Voyage! It was definitely worth the wait!",1
YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT,1
It's a battery. It works.,1
I'm loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy!,1
The best,1
My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.,1
I love my Kindle Voyage. It truly is almost like reading a paper book.,1
Good bargain for batteries! They're great for remotes and toys.,1
Bought this for my 4 yr old grandson. He loves it. Maybe too much!,1
"Amazon basics batteries are just as good as the name brands from my experience. Well packaged in easy open box, whivh I appreciate since I have arthritis. Box is small enough to keep the rest of the batteries from getting all over and easy to find when replacement is needed. A",1
my grandson had one and likes it. so i bought it for my other grandson,1
I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build .,1
"purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!",1
"I've ordered these before and was very pleased. I've just recieved my second set and the quality has held steady. My 5 kids are hardcore gamers and we go through batteries faster than toilet paper, it seems. These are solid performance batteries at an excellent price. I used to buy my batteries in bulk at Costco, but they've raised their prices significantly, so I was thrilled to find these on Amazon for MUCH less. Highly recommended.",1
Great product for the price I paid. Highly recommended.,1
Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.,1
"Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one!",1
These are great devices for the price. Good performance and awesome warranty. Having the Freetime is also very nice as app purchases are less frequent.,1
Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.,1
This tablet keeps them occupied. Other kids enjoy it while they are around with them. It keeps them entertained.,1
I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it,1
"I am in love with this device. Battery life is amazing, so long as you remember to turn airplane mode on.",1
"I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it.",1
"Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality",0
They're batteries so... yeah.,1
I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.,1
What a deal!,1
"My 4 yr old is fully capable of navigating to her favorite games, videos, photos, etc. I like the bumper case too. It has proved its worth already.",1
A great tablet for not a lot of money. Does what the more expensive tablets does for less.,1
I liked it so much I will e getting all my grandkids one for birthdays from now on.,1
Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder,1
working good,1
i like amazon product.but this battery was not good.,-1
These are great- I use these and the AAA and they've performed well for me. I'm giving 4 stars because I haven't formally tested them but I do order them regularly.,1
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.,0
Great Batteries especially for the price! Amazon batteries are now going to be a staple in our household!,1
The price and the amount you get is amazing. So buy these batteries. You can't go wrong they are worth it,1
Works,0
"Was thinking of getting my 5 year old her own Ipad or the kindle. I'm so glad that I picked the kindle, it comes with a kids version of her own log in and is so easy for her to find appropriate games, movies, and apps, even though she can't read yet. She loves it too!",1
So far so good. I haven't noticed them dying fast so they are much better than your off brand cheap knock off ones. We shall see how long they last.,1
"The easy open packaging is superb. No idea how these hold up to other batteries, but I trust Amazon to deliver a good product.",1
Duracell batteries last longer than these.,0
I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded,1
"Packaged well, comparable to duracell or energizer...they work just as well for a fraction of the price so all and all a good buy and will be ordering more when needed......",1
Faster and good quality for this kind of brand ...,1
"Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can't be found.",0
"these batters are a good deal. they die faster than the brand name batteries - for for the price, you cant beat it!",1
I like that it has an Automatic backlight adjustment,1
I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality.,1
"I've been purchasing various sizes of these AmazonBasics batteries for a while now, they're a great value in comparison to other brands. We are often using these in fairly mundane ways---remote controls, small flashlights, toys---but have also had success with them in game controllers that commonly drain batteries really quickly.One bonus with these AAs: they are shrink-wrapped 4 to a pack within the larger box. This makes it really convenient to toss a 4-pack in a purse, backpack, or glove compartment: no loose batteries rolling all around, and you know all 4 are the same age when you pop open the plastic wrap.",1
My daughter loves it. So easy to set up. And keeps everything age appropriate.,1
"I'm a huge Amazon fan and I know the appeal here for most and me as well is the price but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for and these do not last anything near the better more expensive batteries out that. If it's easy to change batteries then this is the way to go but if you have something it's difficult or a pain or you just don't want to the hassle I would suggest spending more and getting the upper brands, and by that I mean the more expensive, most expensive of the batteries out there, they really do last longer. It's a shame because you know they have the ability to make batteries last longer, all companies, and yet they don't just so we'll come back and buy more",0
they work!,1
"Such a great deal for a small fee, just right for a toddler of three.",1
Good batteries for the x box. Now if it wasn't played 24. 7. I could save more money,1
The price was great for these batteries but they don't last for very long. For some items they don't work at all. It's like they just don't have a lot of power. I will not be getting these again.,0
I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store.,0
My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it,1
"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card.",1
"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective.",1
Good power.,1
AmazonBasics AAA rock,1
"I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son.",1
Great Price.,1
Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person,1
"Why spend 2 to 3 times as much just to get a bunny with a drum on the packageThese work just as well as any of the brand names, and appear to last just as long.",1
"Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint.",1
"The Kindle Fire HD 8 edition is just like the adult version except it comes withOUT the special offers (ads). It also includes a two-year warranty, one year of FreeTime, a protective case, and can be bought locally at Target. PIN protected accounts can be set up for adults and children. The Kindle Fire is designed to consume content including accessing Amazon services and content. A library of apps, books, music, videos, and more is available at your fingertips! For the kids, content is appropriate for their age level and screen time can be set. It just works! If you want more than that, the additional desired options do not just work out of the box. I am an older, non-traditional college student with children and some difficulty seeing. I prefer to buy my textbooks or check out books from the local library in the Kindle Edition. There are a lot of advantages to eBooks including being able to enlarge the font, multi-media elements, built-in dictionary, ability to extract notes, and some have text-to-speech. There are also no books to return or mail back. The Kindle Edition format works better with the actual reader instead of just the apps on an iPad, iPhone, or even computer--I have all these too. I need to be able to create content too and apps that may not be available through Amazon app store. A quick web search led me to instructions to install the four necessary files to have Google Play on this device (software version 5.6.1.0) with no root needed from a reputable source. I was now able to add the Microsoft Office apps, YouTube, VLC, a virus scanner, and some other favorites through the Google Play app. The SD card can be used for movies or music too for on the go where access to Wi-Fi may not be available. This part was easy. These apps can be copied over to the children's profiles too. It was a bit more complicated to do this because of the number of steps involved, and it takes a little more time and patience. Bluetooth allowed me to connect a keyboard (can add separately or buy a case/keyboard combo like one made by Fintie named Blade X1) and a mouse too turning it into a lightweight, inexpensive, functional, and portable device great for classes or on the go at a fraction of the cost for the least expensive iPad with a case and keyboard. It is no powerhouse tablet though. However, it does work much better than my under-powered netbooks that run Windows. I only installed the essentials and close the apps I am not using. Unless your child is responsible and careful, I think the charging of the device by an adult would eliminate many of the issues I have seen about it.",1
Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it),1
"Two batteries came with my amazon basics mouse i bought. I was suprised that it took two years for them to die. Definitely buying again, highly recommend.",1
I bought this tablet for myself because I bought the 8 gb one for my 6 year old and was so impressed with it that I bought myself the 16 gb one,1
Their batteries,0
Great price.,1
This is a gift for my great grandchildren ages 4 & 7 years.,1
perfect,1
I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding,1
I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I'll get flowers next time.,1
They are great for what I use them for!!,1
"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem.",1
It's probably the best value for AA batteries out there. They function as expected.,1
Can't beat the price. How long these batteries last or how effective they are still remains to be seen.,1
"Buying batteries is a bummer, Amazon makes it less painful. we like to keep a lot on hand as just about everything takes a aa battery. I haven't noticed any difference between these and the more expensive brand. money saved is a win!",1
"I bought one on Prime day for about 50 shipped and fell in love with it and wanted another one and found this on eBay. I have a Sonos with Alexa, which sounds amazing, but needs to be plugged in. This is a great, inexpensive, portable, AC/DC, great sounding Alexa speaker. I don't understand why it isn't more popular, given the 10 hr battery and all the features. easy to pair bluetooth, easy wifi setup, the Alexa app makes things simple.",1
good basic batteries fair price fast shipping,1
"My grandson really enjoys this tablet, ease of use and lots of different educational programs. Must remember to charge tablet everynight.",1
GREAT BATTERIES and even Better PRICE!!!I will definitely order more when I run out.,1
"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for",1
Good buy!,1
Good battery,1
This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad.,1
"Bought it for my wifes Yoga Training Course.So much cheaper than buying all the paperback books she needed, and she loves it!Cheaper books, music, emails.. What more do you need?",1
Perfect,1
This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel,1
I purchased these for my daughter for camp and open a pack today and they did not work. Fresh out of the plastic wrap and everything:(.,-1
"The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these",-1
My daughter loves her kindle. I swapped out the case for one with a handle so she can carry it but it's perfect for her,1
We bought a pink kindle kore for my daughter and we love it. Its the beat one we have found,1
These batteries seem to work just as good as other leading brands and at a cheaper price point! I haven't had any leaks in anything I have used them in so far.,1
Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things .,1
Love the kindle and the price was excellent. I would recommend it.,1
Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.,1
What can I say. They're AA Alkaline Batteries and they're affordable.-1 Star because the packaging was GIGANTIC compared to the size of the actual batteries.,1
"I love these batteries. I need to buy more. They hold their charge really well. I've replaced almost all my batteries with these batteries,",1
"Duran muchisimo, lo recomiendo",1
I'm really impressed with Amazon products my son really happy..,1
good,1
"The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you.",1
"This was a replacement Kindle for my husband, who used his first one to death. He loves it.",1
Excellent value...best price per battery anywhere...willbuy more when I need them.,1
Pretty much the best price i've seen for AA alkaline batts. I use them for flashlights and also for radios. They come packaged in a nice simple cardboard box and not blister pack.,1
"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size.",1
You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.,1
Great batteries for the money! These beat out Rayovac's and Duracells without a doubt and the price isn't bad either. Comes in an easy to open cardboard box with a small instruction booklet. Each 4 batteries are individually wrapped making it easy to grab a pack and go. Great value.,1
"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt.",1
Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fianc√© downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.,1
"I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you.",1
"Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games.",1
"Works well from outdoors, to plane to reading in bed. No issues. Excellent all around. Better than a light.",1
good product at a good price,1
"Works as good as the higher-priced, name-brand batteries. No complaints.",1
Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.,1
Good and cheap.,1
"he loved it was a great gift easy to use, small and great",1
"Long lasting batteries for my deer cam, compare to name brand batteries for way less money.",1
Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great.,1
"This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones.",1
Good price. Seems to have same life as name brands.,1
"I used daily and its works awesome, the price and performance are good I suggested to my friends , bought last yrs as well gave to my dad, he loves it.",1
I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging.,-1
"I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names.",1
I love that I can read all my books on here and search the internet!,1
Batteries. Standard AA kind. We use them everyday. They power many things and these work as good or better than any others.,1
I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don't mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!;,1
Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.,1
Best one I've owned so far. This is my 3rd Kindle. They only get better and better. The screen is awesome so clear HD quality audio is wonderful easy to set up step by step instruction,1
Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother's iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me.,1
Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it's HD and user friendly.,1
As good as Duracell,1
Exactly what I was expecting,1
"My daughters first tab,I love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his",1
"I got this for my mother as a gift. She absolutely loves it. She was wanting a small, cheap tablet and this fit her needs.",1
I use AA's a lot and have gone to rechargeable's for most things but there are some applications that you need just regular Alkaline's.I bought the big 48 back based on the previous reviews and the value of the bulk pack.I've used these in several applications from trail cams to flashlights and have been very satisfied and find they last at least as long at the Gold colored ones you buy at a much higher price.,1
great deal,1
"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up.",1
Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..,1
This is my third. I buy them for all my grandkids.,1
Works great and have not had any issues. The case is great for younger kids,1
"Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available.",1
Very good deal. Batteries last just as long as Duracell.,1
"These batteries don't work well! My bluetooth mouse wouldn't stay on any more, even when I put fresh Amazon batteries in them. So I bought a new mouse and it wouldn't work with the new batteries. Then I used Duracell and the mouse was fine!Same thing happened with my Roku remote.",-1
Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don't use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too.,1
"Love the fire 7, just what I wanted. Great value for the money",1
"Love my new Kindle! Only had to login, and all my books were there from older Kindle...Excellant Purchase!!",1
Works great and last a long time some of them are still working,1
The grandson likes the learning games that are on the tablet. You can see the progress in his learning from the time he has used it,1
My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future.,1
Purchased as a replacement for a Kindle and it functions well as a Kindle and a tablet.,1
I ordered these batteries 2 months ago. I don't really have a lot of things that require AAA batteries. My tv remote finally died and I put in these batteries. And my remote tells me that these brand new batteries are low.,-1
"expiration of 2026, about 9 years in advance of when I received these.Batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of 5 which is good to provide for protection from discharge after part of the package is opened.",1
Great!,1
User friendly. Simple navigation. My 6 year old Grandson makes a lot of video‚Äôs and it was the perfect gift.,1
Once again...Amazon delivers! I use a ton of these batteries I even tried the route of buying info on how to recharge unrechargables...but in the long run it was a big pain in the you know where so I bought these! I'm happy! Thank you!,1
"This kindle is the 7th one in our house. This was a purchase for my youngest son who is ASD (high functioning, but still has meltdowns when things aren‚Äôt done correctly) and this was to help us travel. Made it through with only one big meltdown. The kindle certainly helped.",1
My PS3 remote control and my television remote controls work again thanks to these AAA batteries.,1
My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon!,1
"used them for multiple electronics, so far... no problems",1
Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.,-1
"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype.",-1
"The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task.",1
"They seem to work well. I've only used three of the pack thus far, but that item is still going strong.",1
I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book,1
These batteries are ok for the price. They don't last very long in a device compared to other brand name batteries. There is a difference! I wouldn't buy them again.,-1
Took awhile to get connected to my home wifi but now that it is it streams flawlessly with no lags in music. Doesn't have the dynamic sound range as other Bluetooth speakers i own.,1
Was as advertised,1
Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.,1
as good maybe in some cases better than the bunny batteries.,1
as expected.,1
I bought this device for my wife. She has been using a Kindle Fire 7.I wanted something with a bigger screen for her.She likes it very much.,1
"Upgraded my kindle, easy and fast transfer from old to new",1
Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again,1
Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.,0
Great entry level tablet/reader holds a lot and it's expandable of 128 GB,1
My son and i use the tablet everyday 2 times morning and night and theres so much to do on it.,1
Our 4 grand kids use these daily charge after charge sometimes .youngest is almost 3 oldest is 9 Just watch the charging cable connection easily broken if charging while using,1
Great that you can add micro SD card for expanded memory. Works great for around the house and long trips. Battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.,1
"I purchased my Kindle2 in March of 09 - and it came with this adapter and cord. It is now October 09, and the small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working. Fortunately, I was able to plug the CORD part into my laptop's USB port, and charge the Kindle that way. While plugged into a wall socket using Amazon's adapter, it does not charge at all (no light, no charge, no nothin'). I tried using the USB/Power adapter for my iPod, but the charge light blinked intermittently, and it seemed to drain the Kindle's battery. I have only had this for 9 months. I think the adapter should last longer than that. Preferably, Amazon could/should have come up with an interface that allows the use of adapters we already have - like for our phones or iPods. It's not rocket science... but it IS marketing. I came online to purchase the replacement, but I'm not sure I want to buy the same thing.... I have both the original Kindle and the Kindle2, and I love the product, but with this adapter, I have to ask.... Why",-1
"Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them",1
Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it,1
"This is a great tablet for the money. It works for what I need it for; checking emails, downloading books and magazines. Great price and very lightweight. I was able to Facebook Messenger my sister who lives in Alaska, which is something I had not been able to do with my phone or my laptop. So I am happy.",1
"I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix.",1
Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound,1
"Works as described. Love the kid friendly foam protector. It stopped working within 2 months of purchase. Amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. Inconvenient, but no real fuss. I hope this one lasts longer.",1
Was happy to get the toy for my son for Christmas and they won't stop playing it,1
"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook",0
Love the product and the price.Batteries work great. I love that I can keep extras on hand. Batteries come in either brown sturdy box or plastic box.,1
My daughter picked this tablet after her HD Fire battery would no longer work. The insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the HD. She wanted more memory for her music does not use it to watch movies really. She loves the blue color and is working just perfect for her.,1
"I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too.",1
"Bought based on price. Now that we have had a few months, it would appear that these are as good or better than other name brands.",1
"Horrible, do not buy.I bought these in AA and AAA and they all lasted just a few days. My battery tester shows them on the lower side of good when unused but doesn't take long before they stop working.",-1
Seems as good as the ones in the store.,1
Excellent batteries. Long lasting in small MP3 player.,1
The tablet offered my son hours and hours of continuous learning and excitement he would not put it down until it went dead and the batteries had to be recharged,1
But the youtube app has so many ads it has the kids on all kinds of stuff.,1
I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.,1
"So far, so good. I haven't had them in a device long enough to report on actual battery life.",1
Work great.,1
My daughter picked this tablet after her HD Fire battery would no longer work. The insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the HD. She wanted more memory for her music does not use it to watch movies really. She loves the blue color and is working just perfect for her.,1
Nice for kids. Like the free apps built in the device. Can control what and how long they get to use screen time,1
"You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip.",1
"Work great for me. I have fairly small ankles so they may be too tight for someone with large legs but they should be fine for average. They DO keep my lower legs from swelling on long shifts and keep them from hurting which is great. And they feel good, nice and silky feel",1
"This Kindle makes reading even more enjoyable. Very light in the hand, amazing back light. Very highly recommended.",1
"There are many batteries in the box for the amount of money you pay. Batteries at the store would cost way more. They seem to be packaged well, and conveniently. I took one star off because these batteries do not seem to last as long as the more expensive batteries, but it could just be the pack that i used. I will see how the rest will work out, but for the money, i think it is a good deal.",1
My daughter loves it we like that it has a worry free gaurantee and parental controls it was,1
Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy.,1
Excellent value. Last as long as brand name batteries at a fraction of brand price.,1
"So far, so good. Purchase this tablet for my daughter.. have more parental control vs the Samsung tablet..",1
Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!,1
"Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks",1
"I love these batteries because they are cost-effective and less expensive than buying smaller amounts of the same batteries at the store.These batteries last a long time, and it's nice to have them delivered!",1
was one of the best thangs i got for my little one,1
Half of the batteries were just dead,-1
Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies.,1
"Our entire family uses it. A tablet at this price , is a terrific deal.",1
"I purchased AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries in July. It has now been two and a half months since I have been using them. They are definitely comparable to the leading brands out there. They are also much more affordable. We have used them in everyday items that need batteries. We mainly use them in our remote controls. Before, it always felt like we were replacing our batteries constantly or hunting for batteries. It was nice to buy this pack to have them readily available and also have the option to purchase recurring delivery if we need them...which is something I will definitely consider because of the convenience. I just need to figure out now how often I need them. This pack has lasted awhile.",1
Great batteries at a great price. Very comparable to Costco batteries.,1
My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter,1
I love amazon basics batteries. They last as long as the name brand batteries for much cheaper. An economical way to keep a good stash of batteries around the house.,1
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.. What more could you want,1
great price - perfect for what I needed it for,1
I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.,1
"Very nice tablet. Nice size, easy to setup. Very pleased with purchase.",1
Came as expected,1
"I bought these to use in wireless microphones at my church. The receivers have battery strength meters built in, so I know when it's time to replace the batteries. These batteries last longer than the brand name I had previously been using.",1
"I keep a good stock of batteries in my house. We have lots of flashlights and toys that require them. These are nicely affordable and I compare them to Energizer batteries, easily. (Don't look at 2nd pic if you're OCD )",1
Just as good as common brand names. Much cheaper. Last just as long.,1
If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.,1
great.,1
"Great price package is perfect to store them in, are as good as the brand names!",1
Great product.,1
I loved them. I got them I while know and I have no complaints.,1
I really enjoy reading and on my iPad was hurting my eyes. This Kindle really works great.,1
"Gift for my wife, she loves it. Reads on it all the time.",1
A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.,1
"My daughter is 1 and doesn't pay much attention to it because she'd rather have my phone. However, as a parent I'd rather have her play with the tablet because it has many free learning game apps.",1
I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.,1
I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.,1
I've only used four so far so can't give five stars yet. They seem to be working fine but I'm not going to test one to destruction so it will be a feel I get over time.,1
"Nothing wrong with these batteries. They seem to work just as good as the named brand ones I buy at the store and they defiantly work better than the cheap-o ones. I am currently using some in a battery operated lanterns, a flash light, and one of my youngest daughters toy. I have not experienced any problems with these.I really like that I can order good quality batteries at a good price and have them delivered to my door. Honestly we could always use more batteries at our house.",1
excellent,1
Best deal on here! A+ rating for battery life!,1
Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.,1
"The Amazon voyage really is a fantastic ereader. Prior to owning this tablet, I had a couple of PW2's which are great tablets in their own right. My wife knew that I had my eye on the Kindle Voyage but I was waiting to catch it during one of Amazon's rare sales events. Unfortunately my wife ended up buying it for me for Father's Day and I planned to take it back and wait for a sale but after comparing it to my PW2 side by side, I decided I couldn't wait for it to get cheaper and so I kept it. The PW2 is a great ereader (ended up giving it to my oldest son) but the Voyage is more crisp and the backlighting is quite a bit whiter. It's also a couple of ounces lighter and slimmer. Is it worth the upgrade? Definitely, if you can get it on sale (usually $150). At $199? Well, that's up to you. Obviously I paid full freight and I don't regret it.....much. :) With that being said, the PW3 is worth a look too. Same 300 ppi clarity but usually $80 to $100 cheaper. The Voyage has a bezel that's flush with it's glass so it's not the ""crumb catcher"" paperwhite is but hey, maybe you want to skip eating while you're reading and save the dough!",1
"My mouse still works with a battery, otherwise I don't think I use them for anything else. ok batteries",1
"First of all- buying batteries is never fun . It's also quite expensive. I fell in love with the fact , I could buy these Amazon branded batteries through prime and get them in two days .But guess what. I got them in 1 day!!! Plus , I stocked up for all those dang Christmas toys for my triplets. If I buy one, I have to buy three!!!!They lasted just as long as a standard battery . Plus , I love that they come in a nice cardboard sleeve. Rather than the ones at the store where they all fall out when you rip the plastic from the cardboard.To wrap up- these were very impressive.",1
It work,1
Great value. Great price. Long lasting.,1
I have bought 2 of these for my grandchildren. They live them!!,1
This was a black Friday deal and we won on this one. I would highly recommend to anyone,1
Cheap price for your standard batteries.,1
Batteries that seem to operate just fine at a great price.,1
Does exactly what it is needed for my daughter and comes at a great price.,1
"I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance",-1
I love my amazon fire tablet. It's got great screen resolution and is very easy to use. It works for both adults and kids. I love the books and all the app options.,1
Great for the price,1
"Can't beat the price for all these batteries. Why would people go to local store and pay exorbitant prices for batteries which you can get at a cheaper price. Maybe they last as long say for instance like Duracell or Eveready but for the price of an off brand, it is still well worth it.",1
Good quality and long lasting batteries. No problems and I will order again.,1
Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere,1
"There ok, not as good as I would of liked for what I need them for. I would purchase again.Fast , good delivery.",0
We only use it for streaming Hulu and playing a few games but it's held its own so far.,1
"Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!",1
As expected,1
No issues with them.,1
Bought this for a gift for some one who's old tablet won't work. Just the right size to play games on.,1
Good batteries and arrived promptly.,1
Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.,1
I got this fire for my friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what i paid.. I highly recommend this for beginners,1
A lot of batteries for a good price! Came on time!,1
This is a quick and responsive tablet. Apps are limited to The Amazon store for the most part so it's important to make sure the apps you want are both available on Amazon and compatible with this tablet.,1
Perfect for my granddaughter birthday. She loves to read. So many books,1
They powered my stuff. Amazing!,1
Best batteries I've ever used and much cheaper than drug store or other stores. I used to buy other brands for much more and tried these and they are awesome.,1
Tried them in 2 flashlights. Neither worked.,-1
I bought for my 11 year old grandson to play games on.,1
Another great Amazon product,1
work as well as any of the big battery brands. Great price. A++++ for amazon.,1
"seem to last just as long as others, maybe just a little less",1
Solid product at a solid price,1
"OK I was a little skeptical of buying Batteries from Amazon. Over the years I honestly never saw ANY competitive battery perform with the big two. After reading all the detailed reviews we decided to try them an with two little kids, we use a ton of batteries. These have impressed us with their performance. Undoubtedly a better bang for the buck than the leading brands, not to mention it is becoming increasingly harder to know that your buying genuine batteries here unless buying direct from the manufacturer like these.",1
Not much to say. They are batteries and they work. Great price and they last just as long as any others.,1
"I love this product and that you can take ""Alexa"" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to ""tap"" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device.",1
Amazed at the Amazon Basics quality. And now I can use my Echo to order them!,1
I have been using this for a bit now. It's wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer.,1
Someone recommended this to us for the 3 and 4 year olds. We bought two as gifts. Best Buy had the best prices. Kids love them and so do we!,1
"nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate",1
"Very easy on the eyes. Easy to carry, fits in my purse",1
This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up.,1
Long lasting,1
"Easy to use, lots of features, keeps kids interested, good beginner tablet unit",1
Everything he needs but nothing more. The case looked a little flimsy but it has been great so far.,1
"This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing.",1
My 2 year old and 5 year old love this. I don't have to worry about them dropping and breaking it since it has a warranty..,1
"What I really like is that you can set up different profiles( boy,girl and myself ) and still you can use any device to play to favorite profile.I bought 2 and kids are very happy.",1
My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!!,1
It's so nice my kids happy they play game with it and watch YouTube kids,1
Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it,1
Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.,1
Good,1
no point in spending money on brand name batteries. these are a great product at a very reasonable price. i don't buy any other brands.,1
A+ Item,1
Since it is a Christmas gift it has not been opened yet. I bought it because I liked it as well as the price.,1
We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.,1
Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.,1
Great buy!,1
Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all!,1
"Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better",0
I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.,1
"This is a great tablet for someone who reads a lot, though the battery could use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious readers like me. I read A TON so it doesn't last very long. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson (can't remember her name) handled everything for me.",1
It's a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips.,1
"The product was for my daughter, she loves it, and plays with it all of the time.",1
The only batteries that I buy now! Price is great and they seem to hold up as good as their more expensive competition.,1
"This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!",1
My daughter loves it keeps the kids occupied. I would recommend to anyone with kids,1
Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features,1
As described,1
Good buy . Works well,1
This tablet keeps them occupied. Other kids enjoy it while they are around with them. It keeps them entertained.,1
Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers,1
"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.",1
"Good alternative to name brand, like the packaging and low price",1
Great price and (so far) I haven't realized any noticeable differences between these and the other name brand batteries.,1
Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price,1
Very happy with these batteries. Works just school as the expensive ones.,1
I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.,1
"Fast delivery, reasonable price.",1
"This is a great starter tablet. Purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. Only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. My son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. Finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases.",1
Great batteries for great price.,1
"I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I've tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device.",1
"I wasn't really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!!",1
These batteries are wonderful. Great price too.,1
Got this for my son he loves it. Very easy to use durable and with a two year no questions ask warranty can't beat it,1
no problems,1
My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks.,0
My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It's easy for them to use and very lightweight,1
"Amazon nailed it. Its readability is superior to the book. The new page turning feature is a great improvement over the previous version. And, BTW, you can carry a library with you wherever you go.",1
These seem to work as well as any in normal devices. They don't last long enough in the high drain but they are much cheaper than putting the lithium in everything,1
This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children.,1
Just as good as the name brand batteries for a better price!,1
Like Thanks,1
Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it,1
Great for web surfing on the couch as well as reading books. Everyone in my family got one as a Christmas gift. Love it!,1
great for the price,1
"These don't last quite as long as Duracell, but for the price it's hard to complain. Nice basic batteries. No issues except for slightly shorter lifespan.",1
Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.,1
"My daughter loves this. She uses it for both games and educational apps, as well as listen to music.",1
I keep purchasing them over and over.Seem to last me longer then the BJ's brand batteries. Price is basically the same,1
"good for reading books. light, handy but not so much for browsing.",0
Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!,1
"great. seems like a well made battery, great price. amazon had super fast overnight shipping.",1
I didn't know Amazon makes batteries at a very affordable amount. Now i know where to purchase batteries.,1
Great learning tool. Kids love it and so do I. So fun to share time with the kids laughing while learning.,1
I'll never buy another brand again. Amazon batteries last! Quality and affordable!,1
Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.,1
Would recommend it to everyone small enough to fit in my purse,1
great value. Bang for your bucks. Packaged well too.,1
"The Kindle Fire is nice to use as a tablet to play games and surf the web as well as download and read books on. It has good speed, keeps a good charge and is affordable.",1
"I bought this computer a 32 GB fire for $79 and I love it.I don't do much on it but; emails, play games both on and off line, and go online for other social media like youtube etc.It takes pretty good pictures. It comes on a little slower than I would like, but it is a great buy for me. Once it comes on it is very fast.",1
It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab,0
I purchased this tablet for a 6 yr old and it is very easy for him to use.,1
i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.,1
Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.,0
I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.,0
Good,1
"i really like the voyage, it looks great, and worth the money.",1
I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one.,1
Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great!,1
I love this product. Great sound quality and at a good price,1
"Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase.",1
Great batteries for a great price,1
Great tablet for a child to have great battery life.,1
This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing,1
Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.,1
"First one out of the box I placed in a Swissphone Fire department pager. Battery indicator had 3 levels, and a new battery only shows 2 bars. That's rather disappointing, I should have stuck with Duracell, they show full charge.",0
Have had other products similar for the kids but this is the best by far. Best Buy had a great price too so decided to try it. Love it.,1
Bought as a gift for parents who aren't tech savy but were able to use it with ease,1
Excellent,1
I needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips. Bought two of these and boy do they deliver!!! The best tablets for this price. The kindle book reader is an added bonus. The finishing is good. My kids love it.,1
"No reason. This product is described as 5W, 1 amp. The Kindle line is mainly 5V (4.8V, what's the difference) and around 1 amp, which is 5 Watts (5W). Why the mystery, guys Also, this deal is for US 110V market only I travel. I like that the previous simple FIRE charger was universal (i.e. 100V-240v). I like that the first Kindle charger was also universal. What are you people doing Or, is it that the copywriter in this case just doesn't understandFor those who don't understand the details of electricity, ANY device will tell you what it needs to feed. Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 volts to meet your device need. As far as AMPS (A). If your device says it needs 1.8 A. It's perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that. Like 2 Amps. The device will only drink as much as it needs. A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charger just means the charger is taking a nap. Just avoid situations where your device needs more Amps than a charger can provide. It won't necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended.",-1
"I love this tablet. It‚Äôs a perfect size. It‚Äôs bigger than a phone but smaller than a laptop. I really bought it for reading but I use it for everything...,games, read my emails, stream music, and search the web.",1
A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.,1
"The ones that I have used appear to work well, and are still going strong. Great deal!",1
These things do not last very long either in the product they are powering or on the shelf. The ones we had on our shelf were not even good to use after 4 months of sitting.,-1
Work great.,1
You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.,1
"Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics.",1
This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.,1
Lasted long good for gaming,1
Had a kindle fire for 5years and just got the new one we use it all the time,1
My second one and works better than the first one.,1
Got two for my kids for Christmas and they're awesome! And also got lucky they scanned to $20 less than advertised price! Woo!,1
"Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year.",1
Love love love Amazon batteries. Every one that I've ordered performed just as well as the name brand batteries.,1
Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price,1
Simple to operate for a 3 yr old . Would recommend,1
Great deal!,1
"A fair sized collection of AAA batteries that seem to function just as long as the more expensive brand. No complaints, will buy them again, as I have several gadgets that run on AAA batteries.",1
super,1
Have not used any yet but is a good price,1
"I love my kindle voyage. It is very little weight and I love the page press that it has, don't even have to move your hand to turn the page. You can read it in the bright sun and in the dark which no over brand of tablets you can do that with.",1
"Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet.",1
Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.,1
Great pack at a great price. Nice to buy in bulk sizes and always have some on hand.,1
"Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don't have to put up the Apple's native apps etc.",1
Never thought I would buy battery from amazon brand. But everything seems good. good battery here.,1
"I dont know what I could possibly say that over 6,000 other reviewers have not already said.. so I won't even go into details. I needed more AAA batteries, and I am a amazon-junkie so I ordered their batteries. Popped three into a flashlight that needed batteries.. and I had light! They work.. Now how they will hold up over time, I do not know yet.. but they work for now and worked in my flashlight so I am happy with them!",1
We bought this for our two year old grandchild he loves it we set up a screen name for him and he plays on it every night! He has dropped it several times and it's fine nothing at all wrong with it!! Very durable!,1
Spend a few more dollars and get a branded one. These discharge very fast. Had to keep changing my wall clock battery every 2 months when I had these. Got an energizer battery and that stayed for more than a year. Didn't expect amazon product to be of such poor quality.,-1
"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.",1
"I ordered this car for my son not really knowing what to expect, and have not been dosappointed. It is the smoothest remote control we have ever ownded and it can go over 50 yards before losing signal. It is a beautiful car!",1
Excellent tablet.....withstands a special needs Grandson.,1
I tested each of these batteries and they were indeed batteries. Would buy again!,1
Great Price,1
I love to buy stuff at best buy Most of the employees are great at helping With everything i needEspecially JISSELA,1
"Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast.gaming.",1
"They are batteries. They are cheap. They work. That is all, goodnight.",1
Good value and quality,1
Simple to use and my kids pove it. Too bad the unit has so much Ad's,1
"I have to change my mouse batteries and keyboard batteries like every two weeks with these..... before it was every few months.... horror story... constantly get ... mouse not connected , keyboard not connected ......sometimes starts within a few days....... going to pay more for the name brands",-1
He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.,1
Like,1
theses batteries don't last very long not worth the money,-1
My 4yo loves this. He can maneuver it easily to go from different games and videos. Stays charged a long time.,1
Very good first tablet for kids without breaking the bank. Have had no issues and the kids love them (ages 3 and 5),1
"Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone",-1
Good product,1
"Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven't had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device",1
Batteries last long time. come in convenient box. Its a deal,1
GREAT very handy to have supplies,1
Love! These guys are just as powerful as any other batteries!,1
She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much,1
Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.,1
"Average batteries, functioning as expected, at a great price. I think I'll see if they've got some AA's at a comparable price.",1
My 2 years old daughter really likes it. It's friendly and easy to use.,1
Awesome price.,1
Great deal price per battery,1
I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed.,1
"OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet!",1
nice inexpensive batteries,1
"AAA batteries. They make things go. I, uh...I have nothing else. I mean, batteries are pretty much--Oh, wait! They're quite shiny also.",1
Good tablet. A lot of tablet for the money. Great for kids,1
Work like a charm,1
This is so so.it is doing good.i do not know how long it can last.this is also pretty good.,1
my son is 5 & is clumsy! hes had this tablet about a month & as many times as hes dropped it still works perfect!,1
"awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies",1
Junk wont charge,-1
All good,1
I purchased two for my grandchildren. They carry the Kindle with them everywhere they go. Great purchase!,1
Have enjoyed learning to use touch screan. Reading email from my chair is relaxing and time saving. So easy to use.,1
"My daughter loves it! She uses it with ease, which makes me an mommy very happy. No complaints. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. Very helpful employees at Best Buy as well.",1
"It's a bargain! Works just as well as regular, higher priced batteries for a fraction of a cost. Highly recommend!",1
"I bought this because it was 30.00 off for the early Black Friday sale and it doesn't need to be charged every day like my fire tablet. (Which is very annoying to have to stop reading because the battery is dying). This stays charged for days! This works great during the day and I bought a Energizer book light for 6.99 that clicks on it. The book light works just fine for night reading. Only con is the magazines I downloaded are not in color which I miss,so I will use for books only. I like the size and I able to carry it in my purse and read as I commute.",1
Way better price than name brand like engergizer. I have a little boy who needs batteries for everything. This way he don't break the bank.,1
I was very surprised as the batteries I got were in date but didn't work very long compared to a generic AA drug store variety. Probably just got a bad batch but I ended up replacing them very quickly in remotes especially.,0
"I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me.",-1
This is awesome! I have a 4 year old grandson and he loves the tablet!!It's kid friendly and has great games that he likes!!Would recommend it!!My 9 year grandson also traded in his drawing pad for a tablet and he loves it!!,1
i have a lot of fake candles (battery operated cnadles) for night light when sleeping use a lot of batteries . i get this pack it lasts awhile. good bargain.,1
Great build qualityGood screen resolution for the moneyCan install android applications -including kodi,1
This device performs great! For the price it's really a steal. Affordable and easy to use.,1
Great batteries. Completely exceeded my expectations.,1
Great buy. Always need batteries. They work just fine.,1
I needed batteries for a set of walkie talkies that I ordered from Amazon. I ordered these at the same time to make sure I had batteries. These seem to last as long as any other brand.,1
"Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one.",1
Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading.,1
Superior to Dura C batteries. I compared new batteries of each brand in the same flashlight. Amazon batteries were brighter.,1
Excellent deal for 36 batteries. I have found the batteries do not last quite as long as Duracell or other brands. Not as noticeable in remotes or such but flashlights will drain them quickly. They are still an excellent deal though.,1
"I purchased a box of 48 AA batteries and the first 2 that I tried to use were dead the other 2 in the blister 4 pack worked fine, but a 50 failure rate is unacceptable. I will update how the rest of the box works as I try to use them. I will purchase a name brand next time.",-1
"I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5.",1
We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY,1
These batteries work great although they don't last super long they do last a good amount of time. not only that they are budget-friendly,1
Bought for my 4 year old very easy for him to use and has good parental controls.,1
My daughter loves it. She can read books and watch movies.,1
This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!,1
It's a good tablet for a young kid. A little hard to navigate even for adults. Cant figure out how to navigate the internet!,1
Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.,1
perfect for the price.,1
"The HD display is absolutely gorgeous. Charging time is speedy, battery life is extended compared to the older generation tablets, and it's very user-friendly. Easy to learn and enjoyable!",1
My daughters love it it is probably one of the best tablets ive ever bought,1
"I sent it for my granddaughter as a birthday gift, seemingly she's enjoying and learning thru it.",1
Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.,1
These are great batteries. They compare with national brands.,1
"This was a gift , was able to talk to an associate and was offered the Amazon tablet at a great price. I'm so thankful for Best Buy and it's knowledgeable sales associates.",1
"Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads",1
I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles,1
"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one.",1
"Great price, and great endurance.",1
I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.,1
Fast shipping and really good quality batteries!!,1
I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who lives in another state. He loves it and plays with it all the time. My son tells me the games on it are mostly educational and really seem to be helpful. Excellent little device to this time.,1
What a deal!!! This is why I love Amazon. Thank You for the savings,1
"Love the size of the tablet for travel, it responds to touches quickly and has a great picture!",1
"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it.",-1
"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now.",1
These are great value and I see no difference between the big name brands. I will be ordering more for sure.,1
Great batteries.,1
It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.,0
"I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love.",1
My little 8 year old guy loves this kindle. Couldn't imagine a better Christmas gift.,1
They were just what we expected and needed.,1
Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack,1
I purchased for reading. It has been everything I have expected.,1
Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it,1
"Price can't be beat...batteries aren't great, but they're so cheap",1
Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading.,1
This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.,1
The Kindle Fire is a great tablet and reader. Everything you need in a tablet at a much lower price.,1
"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",1
These are great! They work just as long as the other brands. I really think they last longer but I have no proof! One thing I love is the price and how Amazon does not change the price all the time. They have sales sometimes but when I run out I can always come back and get the at least the same price if not lower and that means alot to me! I really do not like battery price shopping all the time and this makes it so easy! I hope that helps! ray333ray2001yahoo.com,1
Love it.,1
They are cheep and work well.,1
Great performance from these batteries.,1
My daughter loves her new tablet. Plenty of games and videos to watch,1
She loves it. She is 20 months old and already has command of it. Micky and Minnie rule it!,1
This is a great tablet for the price! Love the pink color!,1
First time using Amazon Fire programming. So far my child and I love the apps and programs. I really love the parental limits and time limits I can set. And that I can set learning and reading limits before play.,1
"Always need a battery for clocks, remote controls, shortwave radio, etc. These are inexpensive enough that I always have a replacement nearby when necessary. I don't know how they compare to the big name batteries but they seem fins for my uses and it is nice not messing around with chargers, etc.",1
I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation.,1
Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.,1
"Using in my Xbox One controller. Battery life is on-par w/ Energizer and Duracell, and like a zillion times cheaper.",1
I bought 1 a year ago for our oldest kid. Came back this year and bought two more. Built really well. This is the best choice for a kids tablet.,1
Hard time getting the free apps to load and the voice app to turn off when my seven year old accedently turned it on.,-1
"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. .",-1
Worked great ..... it entertained my 2 year old just great.,1
haven't opened it yet as i bought it for my grand baby for christmas!....i'm sure she'll love it!!!,1
I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know,1
Great value,1
The batteries last as long as name brand. Great value!!!,1
I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do.,1
Does what batteries should and battery life is good.,1
Perfect and what a deal - very pleased!,1
Super easy to setup for the kids to use. Parental controls are a bonus.,1
"They don't last that long but, since you get so many, it doesn't matter that much.",1
"My son loves his ""tabwet"" lol. Hes got plenty of PJ Masks episodes and games plus much more.",1
"Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat.",-1
Great price,1
They work great,1
"Great price and they work- can't ask for more then that. How does Amazon do what they do- good price, great customer service, and they are very profitable. What a great business model!",1
Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice,1
My wife loves reading on the tablet. It's also great for surfing the web.,1
My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!,1
Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn't put it down,1
"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.",1
"Found these here before Christmas, and decided to order for our children's toys that required batteries. Can't beat the price for the amount you get, they work as expected, and long lasting. In my opinion the box they come in is extremely convenient compared to other battery packaging.",1
Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!,1
I love it it does everything I want can't believe how great it is,1
"Great Price great value, and nice box to store them.",1
I didn't want to buy my 8 year old something really expensive but I wanted a good device so I tried this out and she loves it. The case that comes with it makes it almost indestructible.,1
"Good tablet for kids, only down side is the YouTube for kids app isn't available for the kindle fire",1
Love this!!!!It is kidproof...I have a active 1 year old grandson who enjoy it very much!!!,1
The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it,1
This item is perfect for children and great for parents. It provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child uses it.,1
Bought this for my 3 year old and it is great. Wish it had a bit more storage but overall very happy with my purchase.,1
I bought it for my grandson for Christmas and so far it has been good. It is him that is the problem. He isn't able to understand some of the stuff but will in time.,1
Love this tablet! Super bright colors! Great for gamers! Can't bet this tablet for any price!,1
Hands down best kindle around this is my third kindle and they are all amazing but this one takes the fake love all the new options on this updated model...,1
"We got these because they were inexpensive and we wanted to have plenty on hand for our Christmas window candles that have a timer. I bought the big box because I thought since they were so cheap, we'd have to replace them partway through the season. I'm pleased to say that the original set of batteries I put in the candles at the start of the Christmas season, about 6 weeks ago for us, are still going strong!",1
"There's a lot of space with the Amazon Basics laptop and a number of great compartments, but the material it's made from feels kind of stiff and inexpensive. I was impressed at how much I could get into this backpack, but once it was packed it felt very big and bulky. My normal backpack is a smaller one from Timberline which has less compartments but seems to hold a great deal of stuff and not feel nearly as bulky as this one.",0
Great batteries and will purchase more!,1
The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.,1
serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.,1
The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person!,1
"I love to read books....paper and electronic (via my iPad), but had never owned a Kindle. When shopping at Best Buy, I mentioned to my husband that I might want to try a Kindle....went to another area and, when I returned, the Kindle VOYAGE was in our basket. OK so I though I would give it a try. I LOVE it! So compact, so easy to read my books and turn the pages without swiping or ??? I highly recommend the VOYAGE to existing and pending Kindle readers. So many great features in such a small package!",1
"Got the juice, delivered right to the house, not a dud in the box.",1
The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable.,1
Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............,1
like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.,1
They have a short shelf life,0
Can't beat this price! These batteries work just as well as other more expensive batteries...Will definitely order these again.,1
So far these have worked great and fit the need well.,1
Tried to watch youtube and other video from different sources but it was horrible. The sound would lag w or 3 seconds behind the viewing. Returned for Samsung S2 tablet which is wonderful. You get what you pay for.,-1
"May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries.",-1
Very nice quality product. East to set up and use.,1
I wish it was more user friendly for my 2 year old.,1
Easy setup...bought this for 2 grandchildren under 5...they love it,1
Bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life.,1
"My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it.",1
"They are batteries, power my flashlight",1
Good price and seem to last.,1
"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",1
"The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price.",1
I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. It was easy working with the employee of Best Buy.,1
"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months.",-1
Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.,0
This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members.,1
I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help,0
"Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading.",1
"Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming",1
"Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices.",1
Awesome tablet for kids pre loaded with a ton of things and the case is even better,1
We have been using these batteries for quite some time and none has leaked and all our products are still working that they are in. I would recommend!,1
"they work well so far, cheaper than other batteries i have seen. hoping there wont be any leakage or anything.",1
"Great value and holds up just as well, ifnnot better than name brand! Our household has switch to amazon basic as our new household brand for batteries.",1
Standard batteries work well,1
They seem to last as long as any other akaline battery I've used and at a much lower price.,1
Was not hard to set up and love the quality. Good screen size and clarity.,1
"love the price, love the quality.",1
Very pleased.,1
I see reviews of these batteries mostly on one end of the spectrum or the other. I love em' or I hate em'. Seems leakage is the culprit in bad reviews. I have had no problems with the AA size batteries I ordered.,1
Have used these batteries for quite some time and find them long lasting and reliable.,1
Great specs and kids zone. Fast and easy to set up and use.,1
the batteries were fine.,1
It's a durable tablet geared for younger kids. They can download games for their age level.,1
Seem to last pretty long. Good quantity,1
Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.,1
I love it it's worth buying lots of apps run very good in quick download speed is great Alexa is great on it,1
Great deal!,1
bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime,1
Great scotts that's a lot of batteries and definitely a life saving price,1
This my second kindle .. it's light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I'm ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal,1
My 4 year old daughter loves it. She used the iPad a lot but dropped it and cracked the screen.,1
Got this for my grandson. He loved it. Easy to use .,1
I bought 5 tablets for my grandchildren for Christmas. They loved them. Ages ranged from 5 to 12. Made shopping easy for this grandma.,1
This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.,1
My great granddaughter loves it. Easy to use and it holds the charge well.,1
GREAT VALUE,1
"These batteries work very well and come packaged extremely durably. I am very happy with this purchase. I just wish I had bought more, as these ran out quickly after all the toys my son received for Christmas this year. Can't go wrong with Amazon Basics.",1
Very nice,1
A bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty. A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Things can happen to it. She absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use!,1
"The Kindle Fire is nice to use as a tablet to play games and surf the web as well as download and read books on. It has good speed, keeps a good charge and is affordable.",1
"Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination",0
I believe this is the best Amazon device because of the portability. Quality seems good. Works well with no problems so far. It's a great portable Bluetooth speaker with alexa.,1
"Good Product, Recommended To Everyone",1
"I have used and loved three previous Kindles: the Kindle Keyboard, the 1st gen Paperwhite and the Voyage. Without a doubt this one is the best. This is the first Kindle I can comfortably hold in my hands. I love that if I want to switch from holding it in left hand to holding it in right hand, the text automatically flips. No matter which hand you hold it in the page turn buttons are in the perfect place for your thumb. No regrets in this purchase!",1
I'll never run out of batteries again! insert sinister mad scientist laugh here,1
i would not change any thing on it at all it works very good,1
"Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it.",1
"Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it.",1
"Most of the time I use the tablet for the Web, reading and email, but when I want to work on a Word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, I can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. The screen isn't as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else.",1
"So my son broke my (his) old Samsung tablet that he'd been using for himself since his older brother had an iPad. I immediately thought of the fire kids edition and knew it would be good for him since it's still Android and since it's a very simple fix to get all of his favorite apps on it. A word of advice: Fire OS is very limited, but with a few downloads you can easily bypass the fire OS launcher and even install google services. Battery life is very good, and with the included case now I'm not afraid of another accidental drop. It can handle any of his kids games and with both the Amazon app store AND the play store the possibilities are endless.",1
Great price!!!,1
So far so good BUT the test of a good battery is how long they last so stand by for an update later.,1
"Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it.",1
They didn't last the Christmas season....not even half of it.,-1
Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for.,1
"Tablet works as expected, Apple warranty is a joke. Read the fine print, they don't cover most problems with the tablet. Learned this the hard way",0
Good price speedy delivery,1
Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!,1
Will never buy name brand batteries again.,1
They're batteries.,1
"Downloaded movies for my son to watch and the audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it",-1
"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action.",1
So far they have worked well.,1
Use is all the time. Backyard favorite. Great by the fire.,1
We order batteries keep them stocked at all times. We also order AAA Batteries for the same reason.,1
Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.,0
This tablet works as expected. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who needs a new tablet with great battery life.,1
"Great batteries, great price!!",1
"I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time.",1
I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal.,1
Great price and awesome batteries.,1
I like the batteries. Seem as good as the main brands - However I do not understand why amazon has to use such wasteful packaging in a bulk box. Why pack it in sets of 4 when package is a box. It does not serve any role and just adds to landfills.,1
great tablet for kids when traveling. my grandchild loves it.,1
"I bought these batteries to put into my bluetooth wireless speaker so that I didn't have to always have it plugged into it's AC power source. After only an hour of using my speaker with these batteries, my speaker died! I'm sad and disappointed that the batteries only managed to give me an hour of listening through my speaker, and honestly I'm shocked too. I read a lot of great reviews for these batteries and unfortunately, for me it did not deliver the quality that I wanted and needed :(.",-1
great price,1
"This is just what my father wanted. It is portable, light weight and has an amazing backlight.",1
"This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well.",1
These are working pretty well for me. They might be lasting SLIGHTLY less long than brand name Energizers. But they also cost a little less. Overall I'd say it's a push between brand names and these based on cost per time they last. But they work fine.None of that is said with any kind of scientific testing. That's anecdotal based on how often I feel like I'm replacing batteries.The short version is that I'm happy with these and would buy them again.I got a pack of AAA's too and those work fine as well,1
"Bought this for my 4 years old granddaughter and she loves it. It has all the books, apps, videos that she needs to learn and play. I love it cause she plays on it and leaves mine alone ‚ò∫. It has everything on it and I can set parental guides. Best buy ever! !",1
I bought this tablet as a 13th birthday present for my niece. She loves it and takes it everywhere. She reads books and watches Netflix just to name a few things you can do with this tablet.,1
For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal,1
"Best bang for the buck, love it for replacements.",1
great value,1
Just purchased as a Christmas gift for my glambaby & she loves it !!!! Very nice case for little clumsy & at times rough hands!!!,1
"These batteries are supposed to be 1.5 volts. But I opened and tried to use them as soon as I got them and had problems.I checked the batteries and they only had 1.25 volts upon delivery and of course they are non returnable.Don't waste your money on these, go ahead and pay a little more and get the popular name brands.",-1
"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery.",-1
Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.,1
replaced am earlier version of kindle. not disappointed at all.,1
I have an older kindle and wanted more space. This works very well,1
Her big brother got one so she needed it too! She is pretty good at it!,1
Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera.,0
Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.,1
Doesn't last long.,-1
"7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge.",-1
works great!,1
"Right product, Right on Time.",1
very good.,1
"Always good for reading books. If you get a good deal, buy it!",1
"Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos.",1
"This is a pretty good tablet for kids, but the sound is way to low. Very difficult to hear.",0
Excellent.,1
My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.,1
Great.,1
"I enjoyed the way the Fire 10 transfered all of my books, games and apps. It only took a little bit of time to go through the start up. The Fire starts up quick and I love the larger screen for reading my books. The colors are brilliant.",1
Had problem with cutting off device. Good easy read,1
"Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing",-1
Great batteries. They last longer than the name brands at a great price.,1
"Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!",1
"When I think of all of the money that I've spent so far on batteries, I am actually a bit furious! I buy batteries for all sorts of things for my family. And to think, these batteries were here all along, and I should've bought them along time ago! Amazon basics batteries are definitely worth the buy! not only do you get the size that you need when you need it, you get enough in a simple package that meets the demands that you need, easier open, and, worth the price! For the same amount of batteries that you get even in the smaller package, you would pay quite a bit more for the larger more popular brands that are out there. These batteries perform just like the others!These of been tested in everything from small toys, two Xbox controllers. Please do not die unexplainably or unexpectedly and they just plain work!I'm ordering a larger package I think but the Subscribe and Save option is great for monthly restocking or a staple item used all the time!",1
These batteries work as expected. No noticeable difference in the mAh,1
This was a gift for Christmas. We bought this on a black Friday sale. Price was reasonable,1
"Batteries,..",1
Great for the kids to play with and easy to monitor their time spent on it and the content they can access.,1
Great value for the money.,1
I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.,1
"The battery is great, and the price is reasonable too.",1
This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off,1
I've had these AA Amazon batteries for a month now and I've had no issues. I replaced the batteries in many of my sons toys when I first got them and all of the toys are still going strong.This pack of batteries comes with 48 AA batteries. It comes in a nice box which I'm still using to keep the unused ones in for storage. I think that the value of these are much better than any other brand. At Walmart for a 24 pack of energizer you will pay 9.94 and for a 24 pack of Duracell you will pay 13.97. This comes with double the amount! With a kid I've learned I can spend a fortune on batteries with all the toys that do not include batteries so I will continue to use these. Very happy with them so far!,1
Bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken.great,1
Easy to use for kids as a beginner. Plus it's already got a case on it!,1
"I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers.",1
These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed,-1
"I have bought several products from the Amazon basics line of products and continue to be impressed with everything they have made. The batteries are as you would expect AA size batteries to be. They have a good weight to the batteries, not like cheap dollar store batteries.They seem to power all my devices, including high current devices well. So far they have not leaked or cause any problems. I feel for the price you cannot beat the quality of these batteries.I would recommend the purchase of these batteries.",1
My daughter loves her new Kindle. It has all of her favorite games. I love the parental controls of the kindle fires vs. standard Android tablets.,1
It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.,-1
Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn't be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store.,1
Fast shipping. Amazon basics last longer too. Been buying them for awhile,1
Tablet works pretty good. I purchased it since I was a to make two accounts. One for myself and one for my child. Goo buy!!,1
Have no problem using these batteries. Seem to last a long time.,1
My grandson used my old I Phone to play on. Got him this tablet and he loves it! Great deal!,1
I mean... they work.,1
Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.,1
"Perfect tablet. Would highly recommend, not expensive, and works great",1
"Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far.",1
Just as good as Duracell. Would highly recommend for anyone living on a budget.,1
Love that I could get it in a color! And it's just the right size for little hands.,1
"This is the perfect reader. Price is great, it's easy on your eyes. Battery lasts longer than a tablet.",1
I purchased the Kids kindle because of the warranty plan. Thinking it's the best deal for the money. I find it in no way user friendly for my ha me or my 3 year old granddaughter! She can take my iPad go strength to her folder.,-1
purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software,1
"I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again.",-1
My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!!,1
Great learning tool. Kids love it and so do I. So fun to share time with the kids laughing while learning.,1
Bought this for my 2 year old since he broke his portable DVD player. The only think I don't like is i had to sneakily download the google App Store so I could install vudu on it.,1
The Amazon Fire for Kids is an excellent starter tablet. The supporting games and apps are exceptional. Use of tablet is simple and non-intimidating.,1
Easy to use and love all the things I can do on it.,1
My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better.,1
I know my granddaughter will love it. She has an older one that was given to her,1
Bought this as a gift.. Good price and features for this Kindle,1
"Lasted for barely any time at all. I have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but I can attest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the Amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands. I'm always willing to give Amazon products a try, but these batteries left a lot to be desired.",-1
"had a problem with my purchase, but Best Buy made it good, they are very good!",1
I have bought these several times thinking they were great but after longer term use have found they fail about twice as fast as Duracell. I will never buy them again and will not hold Amazon Basic in such A high standard. my next batteries will be Duracell,-1
Batteries. They work.,1
"A great little tablet built for kids with access to volumes of free apps for a year, including books, games, etc. It can be easily used by kids of almost any age.",1
"This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered.",1
I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory!,1
"I love ordered these batteries from Amazon. Way cheaper then other brands and they last just as long. I love that they come in large packs to save more money, and that way you always have them on hand. I will never buy batteries else where EVER AGAIN!! I love themYou can never have enough batteries on hand",1
"I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. It's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this.",1
I bought 2 for my kids and got a great discount but the one my daughter uses has gave us a little trouble from the start,0
Easy to use for a 5 year old. She loves it. I just don't like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet.,1
"These batteries last as long as the more expensive ones, such as Duracell or Energizer. I will definitely buy again!",1
Great product for the price . Could do away with the adds . But for what you pay they have to make some money somehow . Would give 5 stars if the adds were not on this tablet factory ore loaded .,1
Good Value,1
I was expecting less performance giving that these are the cheapest batteries I can find but I'm pleasantly surprised with the life of these batteries.,1
I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing,1
My newphew loves it! He's 4 years old and can easily use the tablet.,1
Great batteries work just as well as other name brands.,1
Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!,1
"I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet",0
got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet,1
Great batteries and a great price! Finally I don't have to trAvel to ikea for affordable batteries.,1
Excellent.,1
As described,1
"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",-1
We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.,1
We download shows from Netflix and with the child safety programs and apps we are good with or without WiFi.,1
Why spend money on overpriced batteries when you can get AmazonBasics! These batteries work great and are packaged so neatly for storage. I highly recommend ordering these.,1
Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year,1
Love the Amazing fire tablet and the preloaded apps and games. Plenty of memory for additional downloads too!,1
I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.,1
Great battery's for the price.,1
this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business,1
"I extremely enjoy and like my Kindle Voyage Reader a whole bunch! I like reading on it a whole bunch, especially my Living Bible, because I'm a Christian that loves God and Jesus Christ of Nazareth! I believe this product is a very excellent reader, which a person can read all of their books on the Kindle Voyages in their Amazon library! Definitely get one today, because especially, because it is light weight and has an awesome back light for reading in the dark. I like it because it is so light and easy on the arms while holding while reading. God bless you! :)",1
This is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow. Numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent.,1
"Love it , no better deals on the net",1
not even sure if the price and quantity you get are just as comparable than other leading brands. these seem not to hold a long lasting charge,1
"This is a heckuva deal on alkaline batteries. I bought them because my grandtoddler has a remote control truck that keeps getting left on, and of course that eats batteries. I replaced my expensive big brand with these, and so far they seem to be lasting just as long. I am well pleased, and will add these to my purchase rotation.",1
"This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient.....",1
"This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory",1
This product is well thoughts the kids seem to like the apps,1
"What is there to say, but that I love it. Functions well, and lasts a long time.",1
Great quality given price. Has a strong charge per battery.,1
Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need.,1
price time saving a plus,1
The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new.,1
Works like a charm.,1
"This was a Christmas present for my niece, she loved it.",1
As good as the copper ones for much less money. I got tired of paying through the nose for small packages of batteries at my local Wally World. It is nice to have a brick of batteries available. I actually used up half the box just getting everything stocked with new batteries. I liked them so much that I ordered the AAA and D cell boxes. As long as Amazon keeps making quality products for less money they will continue to take over the world.,1
work just like duracell so far!,1
"As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying.",1
Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great.,1
"Excellent price for a tablet. Hit for my daughter, she loves it!",1
I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars,1
"As abv, takes 3 + hours to fully charge. I hoped it would be much faster (maybe an hour), to the point that I had thought I got a lemon. People were kind enough to answer my question, and learned that I should not expect miracles, lol. Apart from that, good thing it comes with the cord, and is compact enough.",1
great bargain,1
"I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste.",1
I see too many people complaining that they don't have as much charge as they want them to but really The price is great! They help a lot when you have a 3 year old who constantly gets new toys that need batteries. These are the only batteries I buy now. I love them.,1
I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational. Now they each will have their own and the dispute can end.,1
Great for the price,1
"The Kindle from Best Buy has made it easier for me to read. This is my first e-reader. I like the Voyage 6 for its brightness and speed, plus thelarge variety of reading material. I know Amazon is in the business ofmaking money by getting me to purchase Kindle books. However, I havefound several Kindle books available for free from my public library. I will, no doubt, buy some Kindle books elsewhere in the future. Best BuyHas been good to me. I did have a little problem finding someone in thestore who was well-informed on this product but finally got what I wanted.",1
I have purchased 3 of these tables still have them just handed them down one grandchild to the next will need another next year. They are tough the heavy rubber case really keeps them safe. Good product!,1
Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage.,1
"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts...",1
This is a grate product and the price very fare just so happy with my Kindle!,1
"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product.",1
"I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games.",1
"Awesome, just as described!",1
I like to read and the kindle is great. It's easy to carry with you. You can buy affordable books. I also like the fact you can access the internet.,1
very nice,1
They worked,1
replaced am earlier version of kindle. not disappointed at all.,1
"I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version",1
Works just as good as the name brand batteries.,1
"Amazon kindle products have always been reliable, consistent quality and this is no different. Very happy with it.",1
"Speaker is really cool. Sounds great, easy to use. Love the fact that it is portable. Only downside I see from the more expensive model is you have to tap the button (not always listening)",1
Bought this for my grandson and am very pleased with the quality. The case protects it well.,1
i can allow kids what i want them to read or play with,1
Thanks for your review,1
Cheap and fine.,1
The sound out of this little cylinder is incredible.,1
"If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids!",1
works well,1
How do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!,0
We purchased for our 3 year old niece and she absolutely loves it.,1
The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!,1
My 4 year old loves it. The amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee.,1
"Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members.",1
They are batteries and they work well and they are a bargain! What else can you ask for :),1
These will last me forever.,1
"This is a great buy and last along time, Amazon Basics is great .",1
"I bought one last year for my 1 1/2 years old granddaughter and believe me, she loves it. She deals with it perfectly. We put a 128 GB card and downloaded music, videos and movies. And she finds everything. A few days ago I bought another for my twins grankids. They are only 11 month old but we are going to start putting their music and movies. With the bluetooth they will enjoy it. I got a Free in-store set up so their mom will learn how to use it.",1
This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.,1
"Nothing special, just alkaline disposable AA batteries at fair price.",0
"I always need batteries and always find myself looking for them or going out to buy some. I use them, as I'm sure most people do, primarily for household items as clocks, remotes and fire alarms. I ordered an assortment of sizes and found they last as long as any other battery I use in these common items. Yes, even as long as Duracell and Energizer. I haven't tried them in items such as flashlights or RC devices as most of the ones I have are rechargeables anyway. They come packaged neatly so I can store them for easy access and I don't have torn to the store. I have found every Amazon Bascis purchases has been of Quite good quality.",1
Bad shelf life. No where near Duracell. For very light duty only.,-1
I use them for my Xbox controllers and they last pretty long. Great for a cheap price.,1
Go with a brand name.,-1
Bought as a gift to go with the vibrator.,0
"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet.",1
I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage,1
"I don't know what you expect to read here. Some elaborate review about how these batteries are amazing from the packaging to the ease of installation etc No, they are AS A batteries that are cost effective and do their job properly. No.magic smoke yet so can't complain. 10/10",1
Very good Alkaline Batteries! I was surprised at the performance and longevity of these batteries!,1
"Great price, great packaging and strong charge. I will buy again.",1
Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!,1
"Bright screen, lightweight, great price, I love it!",1
The batteries were put in each candles at the same time and set the timer to 8 hours on each.,1
"so far so good, great price, seem to last as long as more expensive batteries",1
"I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it.",1
Great product. I always keep them handy to use on kids gaming controls and other miscellaneous items around the house.,1
GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.,1
Weird but some didn't last long as they should,0
Works well .,1
Love these batteries. Was delivered on the day they promised. These batteries are just as good as Duracell Quantum or better. You would be a fool not to buy these if you go through as many as I do. Great deal.,1
This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.,1
Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product.,1
They don't really last that long.. I had them in my mouse I blew through them really quickly. I wouldn't buy them again.,0
I go through a lot of batteries and this is a great buy!,1
This is one of the best kids tablets I have purchased. It's not as restricted and complicated to operate as other tablets I have tested.,1
Great batteries at a great price! Last just as long as the expensive ones. Will buy these from now on.,1
Great ereader. Light and easy to use. Only issue is a bit pricey.,1
Works for me however jury is still out on how long these wilol last.,1
"I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price.",1
great value - awesome product.they seem to be holding up as good as any namebrand batteries at a fraction of the price.,1
i bought 2 for a 3 and 4 year old grand-babies and its so easy to use for both of us.,1
So many batteries that last forever and way cheaper than the name brand ones in store!,1
Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.,0
Love the long life at a great price . I use these daily and compared to the big brands works just as well,1
Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.,1
This holds my grandson attention on a regular basis.,1
"I can't say enough good about this box of AA batteries! I buy these probably 4 times a year because we have 5 grandchildren in our home that have tons of toys, all needing AA batteries! It's nice to have a box of them handy and these are great batteries that last a long time!",1
"We purchased the Amazon Basics batteries mainly for the price and shipping speed and love them. We've used them in all our household products like TV remotes, Xbox controllers and had no issues at all. So far they've lasted about 6 months in the TV remotes and have about a 2 month lifespan in our Xbox controllers which are used daily.",1
This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these.,1
Works as good as other batteries,1
Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.,1
I purchased the Amazon Fire HD 8 to replace my 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp.,1
What a great value .,1
"My husband's previous tablet died a sudden death, so I gave it back and bought this FIRE. The sound volume and quality is much better.",1
Good deal. Good battery. No complaints.,1
The good quality I expect from Amazon.,1
I liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor... Not too big and bulky compared to others.,1
Good value.,1
Best batteries...Forget the others. These batteries last the same or more,1
I usually use li ion rechargeable but I like to keep some alkaline disposable around and these are great and a great price!Chalk up another one for Amazon Basics!,1
"Batteries, they work.",1
the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.,1
"This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!",1
I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase.,1
My sons face lit up the day he saw this and it has been his best friend ever since. I'm so happy we bought this item.,1
"This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen.",1
"I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift.",1
"The Kindle voyage is an improvement on the paper white. It is lightweight, compact, and easy to use.",1
"Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life",1
"Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!",1
My husband has never had a smartphone or touch screen laptop or tablet. The Fire HD was easy for him to set up and learn how to use.He loves it and is very pleased!,1
WE bought 2 Amazon Fire HD2 for our grandkids. The educational apps are excellent!,1
"My kids have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablets have started to become outdated. We have since switched to these fire tablets to help extend their gaming. While if they have never had a tablet before the speeds are OK but Im afraid the processing power of these ""kids"" versions might lag over a short amount of time and they will just become a picture viewer. Time will only tell.",1
I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.,1
Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking,1
Great value.,1
"Worst batteries I have ever purchased - bought them for Christmas items like battery operated lights and candles but they didn't last even a week with limited usage. Spend a little more and get more for your and time, it'll save you in the long run!",-1
Awesome device for my six year old. Very safe useage,1
Great batteries as always,1
Long lasting,1
great batteries - good price,1
Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.,1
Great tablet for my 3 year old son. I am able to monitor his screen time and assure that he is only playing kid friendly and educational games.,1
"Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices.",1
Good cell for a generic brand.,1
These work just as well as the well known brands. I am glad Amazon offers a economical alternative.,1
LOVE THE BATTERIES.THANKS,-1
"1,63 volts",1
i was skeptical but glad I purchased. much faster than Nook or the paperwhite. Thin and easy to use. Screen appears brighter and wider than the paperwhite. Very thin and lightweight,1
Seem to work well will update if needed,1
"I didn't buy just one, had to get a few for my family. They loved it. I want one for myself.",1
Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.,1
Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.,1
awesome,1
It great just a little small then what I would like it have been,1
Dont seem to last very long,-1
It's big then the one I had I would tell my friends,1
The product is very durable and is great for children,1
Purchased one for my older son last year....Got this second d one for the younger one so they don't fight over them.,1
"Shipped lightning fast! I will never buy another big brand battery - especially for bulk use. Gone through the pack, plenty of juice and long lasting.",1
I can't buy enough of these batteries. I bought but the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. I always buy batteries around Christmas for all the toys and devices everyone gets. This year was no exception for batteries. The only thing that surprised me was that this was the first year I needed more AAA then AA batteries. As the year continues to have more demand for batteries and try to keep a good stock in case of emergencies. The AmazonBasics batteries have been working great. They last as long if not longer than the other brands and they cost less. Even coupon clipping and waiting for sales hasn't beaten the price Amazon has been offering. I have made a number of purchases for Amazon batteries already and will continue to make more purchases in the future especially around Christmas again.,1
"Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books.",1
This was purchased as a replacement for one that was dropped one to many times. Hope this one lasts as long and stands up to the abuse the first one endured.,1
Super Price and they are fully charged. My end year date was 2026,1
Very happy with this purchase.,1
The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!,1
Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic.,1
Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use.,1
Love this tablet. Easy to use. And price was right,1
Got this for my daughter after her ipad got too old. Im really surprised how good it works and all the features for the price.,1
"Work like batteries should, got a bunch cheap",1
I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.,1
These batteries worked great! Just as good as any name brand battery but at a fraction of the cost and delivered for free!,1
GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE,1
Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends,1
Great as expected. My third time buying these.,1
Amazon Fire Tablet is a top tier product. Must buy,1
purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction,1
It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet,1
Two thumbs up,1
"We purchased the Amazon Basics batteries mainly for the price and shipping speed and love them. We've used them in all our household products like TV remotes, Xbox controllers and had no issues at all. So far they've lasted about 6 months in the TV remotes and have about a 2 month lifespan in our Xbox controllers which are used daily.",1
"Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!",1
"Easy set up, tons of music, easy to use. If you are looking for voice activated, this is not it.",1
"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.",0
is good,1
This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price.,1
I bought this product for my 4 year old grandaughter and she loves using it,1
"Sorry that I don't have a photo to show- slipped my mind when unpack aging, though this was probably the best packaged thing I've ever received through the mail.. looks exactly like all the other photos that people have shown. Love it such a good price.",1
Good value batteries that are lasting well so far.,1
A+A+A+A+A+ FAST DELIVERY JUST AS DESCRIBE,1
"Works great with good storage but, lacks online browsing speed.",1
I think these are the same a duracell batteries.,1
I love how easy and interactive product is. Set up in a snap with easy to follow directions.,1
"With four kids under the roof, their toys are always in need of AA batteries. I had purchased this AmazonBasics pack of AA batteries for exactly that purpose. The expiration year reads 2024, but after just two years of sitting on the shelf, the batteries that are left are all but dead. They weren't left in cold storage to freeze, they were right on the shelf in our living room. I ended-up going to Radio Shack and purchasing one of their batteries instead.I can only imagine that most of the 5-star reviews for this product are based off initial impressions and short-term use. It's really sad that they just can't hold their own after only two years. Will stick with known brands from now on.",-1
This is not my first time to buy these batteries. I was pleasantly surprised to find these as good or better in longevity of battery life to Duracell. I would recommend these to anyone and I will seek these out over other brands when available.,1
"Is nice for reading, sometimes the screen is a little slow. Hate the ads on the main screen",1
This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn't always careful with their tech.,1
"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead",-1
I love EVERYTHING about our tablets. We haven't put them done since purchasing them.,1
"No issues, unless I put them in backwards. Same quality but cheaper than the name brands",1
I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.,1
Love Amazon basics. Useful products at good prices.,1
He loves his new tablet lots of fun and educational games to choose from and best of all very kid proof he has dropped it numerous times and I see no signs of damage whatsoever,1
Purchased for my wife to replace her previous kindle. She loves it. Great product.,1
Not bad for the price.,1
I put these in a set of lights I have over my door and my Wii remote the day they arrived back in April and they are still going strong at the end of August! Love these!,1
Really good batteries. Use them in my new LED flashlights. Last a long time.,1
"I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things.",1
"Doesn't get easier than this. Good products shipped to my office free, in two days:)",1
"amazon kindle is always the best ebook, upgrade every new model",1
Love these batteries.,1
The battery life is much poorer compared to name brands like energizer and Duracell.,-1
"With having a child an all the toys that come along with that, this was a great price and quick shipping,",1
I bought this for my son and I couldn't be happier. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends,1
"Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase.",1
good price,1
"My two year old loves the videos,games and books this tablet provides.",1
Don't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did.,-1
"Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy.",1
best buy for your money,1
Great batteries for an even better price. Can't tell the difference between these and more expensive batteries,1
"My kids love this product, as do I. Parental restrictions can be set and they know when they have to shut them off. Good battery life too.",1
What a deal!!!,1
Lo cost for long lasting batteries.,1
I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price.,1
loves it perfect for kids sound quality picture perfect,1
Purchased as a birthday gift for grandson and he LOVES it.,1
The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.,1
Love the case it helps the tablet be safe so the screen doesnt break to easy,1
"Great tablets, prefer over the Nabi anyday. Love the color choices",1
"The Kindle was bought for my nine year old grandson for Christmas. He wanted something to play games on and watch You Tube. Works great, no issues. Would recommend for any age, great price too!",1
Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where,1
As expected.,1
have owned 2 kindles this is far the best. no light required. simple to use,1
Great notepad! Huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use. Love it!,1
"I give this as many stars as possible, I recently bought this tablet for my kids to share which I can create their own profile with each their own apps. I also have a parent profile which allows me to download apps for my kids which syncs to their profile . I can view which apps they've used and how long they been on the tablet for . I can also time the tablet for them since I don't want them stuck on the tablet all day. It's just like a regular tablet with YouTube and Web . Except it's so much easier for kids to use ! And comes with a kid friendly case ! Think of it like a cellphone that you let your kids borrow while you get things done around the house , except kids probably click on something else by accident and takes them to an ad which kids hate and mostly throw the phone to the floor . Well this tablet shows the apps, movies and books making it easier for kids to handle without worrying about them clicking something else by accident .It also blocks ads from the applications/games and doesn't let them click on tokens you can purchase with debit card etc.. This has such great quality videos! Very fast and a great amount of volume !!! I love this tablet and recommend it to anyone that has kids !!!",1
"This new Fire tablet with 16 GB of internal memory is an upgrade from my older 8 GB version, allowing more storage of books, movies and apps.",1
"Better and faster than Kindle 7"". Great performance for the price.",1
So far so good. And a very attractive price,1
Excellent Product Price!,1
We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!,1
These batteries are fantastic! They perform just as well as any other name brand battery but they cost significantly less. I never have any worries with any Amazon branded item and these do not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks and get these batteries.,1
"I have yet to be disappointed by an Amazon Basics product, to me a battery is a battery it's the cost I look at. These were the lowest cost per battery on the site.",1
Does not last like energizer brand,1
"I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong.",1
It doesn't work with my Amazon wireless mouse,-1
This is a great piece of hardware...I love it. really good all around..,1
"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine.",0
Beware these batteries - I just packed them up for returning hated to have to do so but they lasted only 5 hours in tiny flashlights for my grand kids !!! Big disappointment too - won't buy this brand batteries again...nor do I recommend them to anyone out there !,-1
I will update my review when I see how long they really last but I gave it 5 stars for price and fast delivery.,1
"The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house.",1
"This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well.",1
This is the perfect tablet for a beginner. It is sturdy and has everything he needs.,1
This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson and he loves it! He is able to download lots of games and the rubber case keeps this device well-protected.,1
Great batteries for a great price!,1
My mom was looking for a affordable tablet. I bought mine at best buy last November. I recommended the fire tablet and she loves it.,1
Everything satisfactory.,1
But these every time,1
"Haven't use any yet, but I feel good about AmazonBasics products",1
They're batteries. They work. Simple as that.,1
Good value.,1
"I bought this for my 8 year olds birthday. It is perfect and all 4 kids have their own profile so there is no fighting. The parental controls are awesome, we set daily limits for them, but then they want to share with each other when one is done with their time. We love it.",1
"I love my Fire and the fact that I now have a place for my ""library"" that's not taking up space on my phone.",1
Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member.,1
"I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!",1
It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.,-1
This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.,1
Great value for the money.,1
This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.,0
I like it,1
My kids love the tablet and the battery life is amazing.,1
Great delivery time and was so happy to get these. So much more affordable than store bought batteries. Soon as I got them I put them in 2 different remotes and all worked fine! Would definitely recommend these to anyone!,1
I particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. I use it with Kindle Unlimited.,1
"Good batteries, great price.",1
great an the price is wonderful,1
Seem to be as good as any and the price is better.,1
I really like the price and quality of the product,1
"Grandson loves this tablet, does everything he needs",1
I would buy another one for the priceGood product,1
"I needed some regular batteries to toss into random things where my rechargeables normally get lost and forgotten. Normally I prefer amazon's brand, but these white batteries were just not that great. Some of them barely worked. They were very inconsistent.",0
It's great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use.,1
Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Keeps her busy for hours.,1
"With the recent promotion for the Amazon Fire HD8 tablet, I just had to get one. It's been a while since I bought a tablet and the one I currently have is getting to be very slow.The tablet will come with a micro USB charging/data cable and a wall adapter.The tablet itself has some weight to it compared to the kindle tablets but won't be a problem if you use it to read sitting up. Initial setup was very straight forward. Once you connect to the WiFi and login to your Amazon account, you should be in the FireOS interface. The tablet is bundled with Amazon apps so everything is just a few swipes away on the screen. The interface itself, is very smooth so I didn't notice any lags at all. I did try a few games and there were some that were a bit slow at times and this was expected from a tablet at this price range. I will mainly use it to browse online and watch videos so don't see this as a huge setback.The buttons, charging port and headphone jack are all on top which will need some getting used to since most devices I've used had side buttons for the power/volume and charging/headphone ports are at the bottom. To the left side are two speakers and there's a micro SD card slot on the right for those who need more memory. The memory card option will be handy since this tablet is only 16GB and I think you have about 11-12GB free out of the box.",0
Best price for the number of batteries. Also last just as long as any of your name brand ones,1
These batteries just don't seem to last as long as Everready batteries.,0
work great in solar lights.,1
The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case,1
they work,1
great price,1
"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it.",-1
ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BATTERIES IVE EVER USED AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL THEM,-1
THEY WORK FINE,1
Cheap and do the job! Like how they're packaged!,1
Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time,1
Pretty sure these batteries are way better the name brand batteries! Don't get sacked into name brand when you can get just the same from the amazon store a,1
"I bought these to use in my Xbox one and 360 controllers. These batteries are great but then again 2 batteries might last 3 nights, the next set you put in might die in the same night or they might last for a entire week. These seem to be doing better than the rayovaks.",1
good tablet for the price its quick and easy to use,1
My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained,1
Great product. She uses it everyday. Super light and easy to navigate.,1
Works great for my Kindle!!!,1
"I bought this game for my son, and he loves it..it is very entertaining.",1
Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.,1
"I love my smart portable speaker. It has games, weather, news, podcasts, radio stations, etc.If something is missing, I can connect my Bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application I want.",1
"For this price everybody should have one of this tablet, it works really good",1
I love these batteries. They last a long time. I highly recommend this product.,1
I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.,1
"Great unit . Computer died so I got this , works great . Does everything I need . Need to set up remote printer app. Yet",1
almost most of the batteries drained out in 1 or 2 weeks with moderate use,-1
"I prefer the Kindle to a book. I like the change of letter size, storing many, many books, and the ease of carrying it. I love to read when I travel, and this is the way to go.",1
Nice batteries will but again,1
Got two for my kids for Christmas and they're awesome! And also got lucky they scanned to $20 less than advertised price! Woo!,1
"Great batteries, great price!",1
I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!,1
I like that it can be used as a regular tablet but also have a separate account for my niece where she can‚Äôt get into anything crazy.,1
"My daughter just turned four. She loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games on her Fire. It has a short battery life compared to other big name brands but still good, usually around five or six hours. The included amazon free subscription is great, lots of great content from Disney and other quality brands.",1
have had good luck with these batteries in many devices.,1
"I didn't conduct an official experiment, but they seem to work just as good as any other batteries out there. Perfect!",1
These work very well but took longer than expected for deliveryl,1
Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.,0
"Awesome price! If there is a difference between these and the big name brand batteries, it's not a significant difference, because I can't tell. These seem to last just as long as the others in my opinion. Will always buy again!",1
links up with up local library. good to read in sunlight. can check web and emails. close to having a tablet but have to figure out what apps work with amazon.,1
Lives up to Amazon standards ..,1
Thank You,1
As advertised. Is what it is. Great value.,1
Batteries work really well,1
They work and are cheaper than warehouse prices.,1
OK,1
"They are batteries, folks. I just got them to have them available.",1
Why buy expensive batteries from Target or Lowes or Home Depot These much less expensive batteries are sure to do the trick! They work just as well at a fraction of the cost its a no-brainer purchase.,1
"My son was 2 years old when he received this tablet, the apps and games are fun and instructional, the cover really nakes it drop and shatter proof, I have it set on a timer so it turns off after 20 minutes of use, on days when he seems to be more interested I will let him use it longer, other than thats it is so simple a baby can use it.",1
"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much.",1
Definitely what I need,1
"I find it amusing to ask Alexa simple questions and timers. Not liking the messaging part that doesn't integrate with my iPhone, but it has awesome notifications and does sync with my Google calendar. I feel it was an EXCELLENT purchase.",1
"I wish I could just say it is one of my best investment, I love the fact that now I don't have to drag around several of my favorite books I can now have them all in one convenient place the battery life is great my little girl loves that she can play games on it I think it's great I should have gotten more memory though",1
"For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve.",1
"awesome price for decent batteries. they hold up fairly well, haven't run them through any rigorous tests, but when I put them in the remote control it seems to work again.",1
"We purchased these batteries for remotes and any other small gadgets (non-demanding cameras, etc.) around the house that use AA. I will continue buying them as so far they have fit our needs perfectly.",1
WORKS GOOD,1
I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!,0
My granddaughter loves it. It was a perfect gift for her long airplane trip.,1
These batteries are just adequate not super strong as advertised.,0
Like,1
"My other daughter has this same tablet, so I knew it would be a winner with my other child as well.",1
Great deal,1
"batteries suck! brand new out of box dead or close too. Change smoke alarms every month and remote batteries every 2 weeks.junk dead, 3 different boxes and sizes of amazon",-1
Lasting a long time in my remotes. Nice easy to open packaging.,1
"That was for my husband, he really loves this product,watching news,movies and video music..",1
"I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet.",0
I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal.,1
"I'm a self proclaimed bargain shopper. But at the same time I want a quality product. I make a point of reading reviews to make sure that there are some satisfied customers before I take a chance on a product. I'm happy to say that these batteries were a good choice. I have grandkids that love to play video games using remotes that use 4 batteries per controller. They go through these things like crazy. So, finding some that were affordable was necessary to keep everyone happy.",1
"The amazon kindle is nice, portable and very easy to use.",1
"I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids.",1
Inexpensive however I do feel that the power doesn't hold as much as other batteries that are around the same price like Best Buy's Dynex brand.,1
"Christmas gift for my 4yr old grandson, he loves it. Easy for him to play by himself",1
They work,0
"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(",-1
"I wanted a basic reader without a lit screen (I'm looking at computer screens almost all day). This reader fit the bill perfectly; doesn't get hot, long battery life, easy to navigate. I love downloading books from the library now.",1
IMO they have perfected the display. even lighting. no glare. and now it's waterproof??? incredible.,1
"I looked at the math about the capacity and strength and longevity of different batteries and a lot of them are similar, including these, and these make the most sense price wise.I have tried HUNDREDS of rechargeable batteries and they get recharged a couple of times and then disappear. At a certain point they are just a waste of money.",1
"This is great tablet for money, it's fast and easy use, Best Buy delivery was fast and product was package well and I will buy again thanks",1
"So far these are holding up very well and for the price, couldn't pass them up.",1
"Really comfortable to hold, 7-inch screen looks fantastic and offers some features that could be useful. If you use audible or like to read near water (poolside or in a bath) then this would be the e-reader to go with. If not, then I would just stick with the Voyage (if you're a hardcore reader) or a Paperwhite for casual readers.",1
"These batteries are great, and I love the price on subscribe and save. With so many kids and toys and things requiring batteries, I get this every 2 mos.",1
"This tablet is great for trips. Just make sure you download games and shows on it first since it does not have Internet. The case is great for kids who are rough with technology, it really takes a beating.",1
"I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page.",1
My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle.,1
"Like a lot of reviewers here, I struggled to find the right Bluetooth keyboard to go with my Kindle Fire HD. In the end, I decided to go with the Amazon one, figuring that because Amazon made the Fire and the keyboard, there would be fewer potential problems. At first, this was a good theory. I opened the keyboard as soon as it arrived and paired it immediately to my Kindle Fire HD. There were no problems and it worked perfectly.At first.Unfortunately for me, the next time I worked with the keyboard, I was on a plane trip. I decided to get some writing done (I write novels in my free time) and fired up the keyboard and the Fire. But this time, the keyboard wouldn't pair. At all. The Fire SAID the Keyboard could be paired -- it remembered they had been paired before -- but it just wouldn't pair it. I tried everything I could think of, including pressing the connect button on the keyboard several times to re-pair it. In the end, I had to give up. Instead, desperate to use the flight to write, I borrowed my wife's iPhone 4S. Oddly enough, that had NO problem connecting to the keyboard and I was writing in no time (albeit on a smaller screen and in the notes mode).When I arrived on vacation, I was worried I had a lemon on my hands. Sure, the keyboard worked, but not with the Fire, only the iPhone. That wasn't the plan. I noticed that other reviews said that the keyboard worked initially with the Fire and then wouldn't work again. I thought there was a major glitch.I decided to keep messing with it and discovered this problem and solution. If you ONLY pair the keyboard with the Fire, you will have no problems",1
Absolutely love this tablet. This is the second one we have purchased for our 1.5 year old. Our 3 year old has one as well,1
Tablet is wonderful for young kids. There's ways to switch it to kid friendly,1
The good quality I expect from Amazon.,1
"Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too.",1
It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web,1
"We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!",1
Great product for surfing the internet or reading books!,1
"Great value...and so far, quality holds up.",1
Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games,0
"Triple A batteries at an amazing price Need I say morePretty basic, hence the basic logo. Don't waste on a different brand, but Amazon Basics!",1
"They work great. I buy both these and the rechargeable ones. Couldn't pass up these with the great price. :)As I said on the rechargeable ones I bought, make sure they are room temperature before using. If they are too cold or hot from transport, they might melt or explode... But that goes for a lot of batteries. :)",1
I bought this thinking that I needed it but I didnt so it was a waste of money. I do so hate to waste money. the Kindle can hook to a regular cell phone charger and it comes with a cable that connects to the computer. For some reason I thought I just had to have this too when I bought my Kindle.,-1
"So far so good, no duds",1
Nice gift for the grandson. He will get much use of it! It was nice that it was available in different colors so that he could tell his apart from his sister's.Nice size for traveling with.,1
My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase!,1
I use it everyday after work for down time.........,1
Great buy!,1
"Verified PurchaseI got the kids version because this is mainly for my toddler. I know, I know, yes I did get this for my toddler. He is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect.",1
The design is good. Love to read books with this beautiful device. The battery is not very good though.,1
"Very durable, but could be a little more suited for young kids.",1
Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it,1
Grand daughter is two years old and watches her older brother and sister use their iPads. So we got her the Amazon Fire Kids Addition and she loves it. She has a great time with learning numbers and the alphabet.,1
Great for the price!,1
"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok",0
I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife.,1
I ordered the extra case not knowing the device came with a case.,1
"Work great, and at an affordable price.",1
"Lasts as expected, very good battery quality",1
"Great value, just as good as the name brands. With a baby, you go through a lot of these.",1
Amazing tablet for the money. Gave one to my wife for Christmas and she loves it,1
These batteries have a very short life. Need replaced every week. Used ina solar light outside Very unsatisfactory,-1
Great deal great product!,1
"they are batteries, they work",1
I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.,1
"Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners.",1

"This tablet is not as good as ipad when watch video, but good enought to view webpage and ebooks. I'm satisfied.",1
My daughter loves her tablet she takes it every where with her.,1
like it for the money,1
Pleased so far with these cells.,1
Great product!! My daughter loves it!!! She is two years old!!! Kids mode is the best.,1
"Great tablet for the grandkids, they love it great item",1
"I bought two of these for my two grandchildren. (A 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl) So, I bought one in pink and one in blue. We down loaded age appropriate games and they are lifesavers!",1
This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one,1
"Just opened a brand new box of Amazon AAA batteries 100 count . Sorry Amazon, but I had to open several packages of 4 only to discover. That most of the brand new batteries contained in the box arrived DEAD. I put a meter on the batteries to check for voltage. Some read 1v DC some read 0v dc and some read 2. volts. The batteries I removed from my head set were weak but at least had 1 volt As you can see in the photo the freshness date states 12-2026. . I certainly expect to find more dead batteries in that box. I don't have the time to check each package of 4 right now. Not good Amazon. I am concerned, because I purchase your packages of 9 volts and packages of AA as well. will I be surprised and disappointed as well",-1
Love these batteries.,1
Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it,1
Great price. Lasts as long as any other batteries. Love Amazon Basics.,1
My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it,1
I wanted something simple for my Mom to use and this is perfect for her.,1
"Small and compact, surprisingly good image and sound.",1
These AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries are actually AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries and work as such. Unbelievable.,1
"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!",1
Very study tablets. 2 others grands liked theirs. Salesman was very helpful finding 2 different color models,1
Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.,-1
"I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price.",1
It's such a great tablet !!! Love the picture and everything about it is amazing. I'm glad I chose this one and what a great deal I got on Black Friday,1
I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.,1
Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet,1
"I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption.",1
"Just batteries. Nothing was wrong - it's nice to have so many batteries at home for this price, that's it.",1
"It's very easy to connect devices, and it produces a good sound. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",1
"The tablet is great overall. Its fast, smooth and many options to check out with regards to apps and programs. Great also if you have an Amazon account and also Kindle as well.",1
"For what it is, it is a great tablet. Very responsive, great graphics everything you would expect in a good tablet. My problem, I was raised on Android! I'm having a terrible time trying to understand how to convert from Android to Amazon. If this is your first tablet and you know nothing about Android or Apple you're going to love this tablet.",1
Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.,-1
Amazon batteries are always a GREAT deal!,1
I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps,1
So far so good. Great price for everyday batteries.,1
Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane,1
great bargain,1
My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.,1
I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.,1
"Overall, happy with the product. They work well.",1
"I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can't recommend this product enough.",1
Do not hold charge as well as major brands.,-1
I purchased these a little more than skeptical about how long these would actually last. But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through. So I said why not and bought them. They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and gadgets require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surpised I was with these. They come in a card board box which is was nice and easy to store. The batteries are wrapped up into groups of 4's. They hold a fairly long charge so you don't have to change them out too often.,1
Great batteries for the price. Item is as described. Please keep in mind these are not lithium batteries so they won't last as long as lithium batteries. Product was delivered in 2 days with Prime membership.,1
It is a nice tablet for kids and my son enjoys it.,1
Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!,1
Works great! Just the right size. Would recommend to family and friends.,1
This is my second kindle fire. The 6th gen is an even better experience. Glad I preordered.,1
"The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7"". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places.",1
I've never actually paid attention to how long batteries last in anything. Still don't. These are working though!,1
These batteries are a great bargain. I bought these for my mother's blood pressure machine which gobbles them up. They last just as long as the name brands that she had been using.,1
great,1
good price and quality,1
Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts,1
All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit.,1
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Love the fact that it has a two year warranty against breakage and also comes with a free year of Amazon Free Time.,1
Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.,0
Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up,1
The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it's much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better.,1
They last as long as Rayovac batteries.,1
This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps.,1
I use these for my remote flash triggers and my intervalometers and they last a pretty long time.,1
"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time.",1
I‚Äôve used one on multiple occasions. They seem to user friendly so I bought 3 of them for Christmas gifts for my nieces and son.,0
"There ok, not as good as I would of liked for what I need them for. I would purchase again.Fast , good delivery.",0
Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants,1
My son loves it. Light weight. Good price for a great product. I would purchase another one.,1
My only problem with this tablet is if you don't have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them.,1
This tablet is great and easy to use. Very convenient and handy to have around,1
This kindle is very slow at recharging. Granddaughter has a hard time waiting for it to charge.,1
Its a good product and also you can be monitoring what can your kids see,1
great,1
no complaint,1
"While there are many budget tablets out there, not all of them are functional. This one is. If you are part of the Amazon universe this links seamlessly. Book purchases sync without effort. Movies are easy to see on Amazon Prime and you can use Netflix also. Alexa is an added bonus. Not sure the camera will get much use but it is there if you want it. Amazon is slowly opening up their market place to other popular apps so expect more. (Note: I turned off the WiFi and just used this as an e-reader and didn't have to charge it for almost 2 weeks!)",1
I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.,1
These are great,1
working great,1
Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.,1
"I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration.",1
Good quality,1
"This is a Great budget table, it has has Great features for the price",1
great value. a toss up between these and Duracell Procell bulk batteries for value. I will buy whichever is cheapest. 1.60 volts and long life,1
"Works great for my daughter, great price and apps.",1
I use this tablet often. It is the perfect size. The battery last a long time. The quality is great for the price,1
So far no issues. They're great batteries. They're such a good deal that after I got these I replaced the batteries in every device I own that uses batteries (to avoid old batteries corroding and destroying anything). So far dozens of devices (from flashlights to remotes) have been working perfectly. Very happy!,1
Amazon batteries over good performance at a great price. Nice option to replace more expensive name brand batteries.,1
"Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome.",1
amazing price,1
good,1
"I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear.",1
Works great with wireless mics.,1
Very good batteries,1
"Work great! No leakage or discharge (so far) like we've had from some other store brand batteries. Not quite sure how long they hold up, but they seem to be doing as well as the name brand batteries.",1
"Great little lap top with touch screen, absolutely ruins you.",1
"Work as well as any name brand batteries I have used. They are not the cheapest batteries, but they actually work as well as name brand batteries which is something most discount batteries cannot do.",1
"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50...",-1
Christmas gift for my grandkids.. IÔ∏è will update once she uses it..,1
"I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn't expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet!",1
"This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good.",1
"The batteries are the very worst I have ever used. I use a wireless mouse for work, and I've had to replace the battery every 2 weeks, instead of once a year like my old batteries. By the time you figure out how bad they are, you will be outside your return window. A fail for Amazon if you ask me, and makes me question whether I should keep shopping with them.",-1
Great batteries at a good price!,1
"Shortest life batteries ever, waste of money",-1
I bought 2 for my grandchildren so they can do their schoolwork on it..after xmas I will make an appointment with geek squad to have you show them how to use it...as I don't know how to...,1
It was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time,1
Batteries last for about 2 days in my Xbox one controller.,-1
We was looking for a easy tablet that has all the great features and functions that a young child can learn and grow with. I will be a great Christmas present.,1
"I bought the large box because I use a lot of batteries and also purchased the set of four Everyday Essentials LED lanterns. Now, I will be prepared the next time the power goes off. What's to say about batteries I trusted Amazon contracted with a good battery manufacturer to produce them and carry their brand name. At about 25 cents each, you cannot do better.",1
They don't have as much juice as other name brand batteries but they will get the job done.,0
"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!",1
Grabbed these fairly cheap and didn't expect much. I use these for my Xbox one controllers and have only gone through 2 sets so far. This pack looks like it will last some time until I pick up a rechargeable battery pack. Beats your dollar store batteries by a mile.,1
"The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. I want it for travel and portable convenience when a full-size tablet is too big and heavy. It's perfect.",1
"This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use.",1
"This is a best bang for your buck deal, very reliable and the price was perfect, especially for beginners",1
Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product,0
I recently bought two new amazon tablets for an 8 and 10 year old and they're thrilled with them!,1
"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good.",1
"Dude. These lights are so amazing! They are the perfect addition underneath our kitchen cabinets. I really love the remote, which allows you to not only dim the lights, but it also has a timer! The individual lights came with two small screws to install, as well as 3M tape. We used the screws for a more durable effect. The lights also came with brand new batteries in them to get you started! As an interior decorator and stager, I'll tell my clients about these. Great product!",1
Unsure if I wanted to get another kindle or an Amazon tablet. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to use and a great price!,1
"These batteries are okay they don't seem to last as long as brand name batteries, but you can't beat the price for these.",0
I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money,1
They're batteries.,0
My grandson really enjoyed this product. Good deal.,1
"Just as good as the name brand ones I get at the store. LOVE buying batteries at Amazon, it's SO much cheaper!!",1
"Brought these because, I'm always forgetting to get battery's. I now find it easier to buy forgetful things from amazon. These battery's are lasting a nice amount of time. I brought it for my WII and haven't had to change the battery since I put it in. Great buy for a great product.",1
"These are great batteries to keep on hand around the house. There's nothing really fancy about them. They're basic, they work, and the mulit-packs are very affordable (much more so than the ones I usually buy). They seem to work just as effectively, but they were less expensive AND saved me a trip to the store. It's a win-win!",1
I bought this because I recently signed up for Amazon Prime and wanted to take advantage of the free books. Nice tablet.,1
I purchased this case based on appearance and quality as shown on the picture with details. I was even more impressed upon arrival. The case has everything I need. A separate compartment for my A/C power cord. The padding is well constructed to protect my Notebook Computer. Well worth every cent I paid. I am extremely please by all the features.,1
Will use again,1
i really enjoy this tablet made a great christmas gift,1
"Reviewers aren't wrong.The Amazon Basics Performance batteries are long lasting. My grand kids go through a lot of batteries with the toys I keep for them. Buying them locally costs a fortune! These larger packages of the Amazon Basics make the price per battery so delightful. And they last with good power for a long time!Thank goodness for Amazon, and for their brand!",1
We've been using this in our backyard laser tag guns. We have played many times and I have not had to replace them yet. They seem to be keeping their charge very well even with our guns.,1
Great product for the price! Works great and comes with ample storage.,1
I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one.,1
"I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!",1
Its a very nice tablet if you use it for basic stuff. And does alot if things. I love it,1
"Bought one of these two weeks before on Amazon and paid almost double for what Best Buy had these for. So, i bought another one the same day as this!",1
This is my 3rd order of AmazonBasics batteries. Very pleased.,1
They work great!,1
Basic performance didnt last a week in an AM radio.,-1
Are you crazy this is an amazing deal for batteries,1
"The 8"" version is much better than the older 7"" version. Better graphics and faster processor",1
Why notI gave them a shot and I do not notice a negative difference from other brand batteries. The positive is the packaging. They come in 4s and so you do not have to open the entire pack for a few.,1
Wanted a tablet easy to hold bigger than my phone smaller than laptop. This is perfect,1
This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.,1
"Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away.",1
Batteries made it here safe and undamaged.,1
Like it.,1
This is such a good value,1
Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus!,1
"Very happy with purchase, very powerful.",1
Great price for batteries,1
Not great for use in video game controllers. They drain really fast.,-1
These seem to work as well as any other name brand batteries. I would buy again.,1
The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.,0
"Easy to setup, and easy to switch between adult and kid profiles. The foam case allows it to take a beating",1
"Cheap, Well-made, great deal!",1
They die a little faster than expected but hey their batteries when you need them,1
Loved this. Bought it for my 5 year old. Can't wait.,1
"My kid loves his new tablet , this not only teaches him new things but also entertains him for hours.",1
"Love this tablet, it is better than my ipad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!",1
I believe this one is more better than Duracell. Will buy again .,1
Good value!,1
"I recently bought these to use in my Streamlight Microstream flashlight. I've carried one every day for the past 4 years and I love them. I say them because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on.",0
"Great price and they work- can't ask for more then that. How does Amazon do what they do- good price, great customer service, and they are very profitable. What a great business model!",1
It's a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips.,1
Only way I'll ever buy batteries again.,1
"Ahh, they're batteries so not much to say except they work LOL",1
can never have too many batteries on hand,1
"I bought these batteries mostly because I was giving gifts to my nieces and nephews and they all needed either AA or AAA batteries and buying packages separately can get really expensive. I have been using these AAA batteries in some of my own electronics and they work well. They don't have the longest life but they don't die super fast either. I can get a good amount of use from these batteries. Of course it depends on how often and how long I use the devices but I don't notice a dramatic difference between these and higher end brand name batteries. For the price, I am happy with these. I have not had any leak and none so far have been duds. I am going with 4 stars. Not the best you can buy but certainly worth the price!",1
just as described,1
This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.,1
Best deal and work as expected,1
"I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it",1
Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up,1
"Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use.",1
It‚Äôs the perfect size and weight. I have had iPads in the past but decided to try this and will not go back to iPads. It does all I need.,1
"This is great for kids, it grows up with them, all the apps are good. My kid loves it",1
my grandkids love it and they are five and they work it themselves,1
Bought for my grandson. He loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.,1
"The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task.",1
I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.,-1
Great battery's for the price.,1
"These batteries are the bomb. They work just as well as top brands (Energizer, Duracell) and are like half the price. They shipped super fast and there are so many that I still have some lying around from my order last year. Definitely will re-order when I run out. :)",1
great for the teens.,1
Great deal on batteries. Love it. And they last,1
"Cheap but doesn't appear it particularly. Does it's job fine, plenty of pockets and space, much prefer it to the back pack style",1
Loved the price and when received that there were actually smaller packages of four instead of a bulk pack. Better price than Sam's or Walmart at the time of this review.,1
nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain,1
"I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store.",1
I love my tablet!! I didn't think at first that I would like this size but it is perfect for me. I would recommend this tablet to all my friends.,1
We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air,1
"Purchased these 3 months ago in addition to a higher end () brand that came with a 9 docket charger. The higher end rechargeables are still going strong. These leaked battery acid all over my charger and ruined one docket, and ruined an under cabinet puck light. Save your money! They won't last!",-1
Worked as advertised.,1
When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.,-1
The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.,1
My grandson love it. Works great. Applications are good for education purposes.,1
"I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!",1
My kids have gone through several Amazon Tablets and this one is by-far the best one I have seen.,1
"Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price.",1
"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips.",1
great deal. last a long time.,1
Great price and fast shipping.,1
Wore out quickly,-1
This washer and dryer is very basic but still nice with lots of options. Great for my small family. Worth the money!,1
Love my kindle ! I enjoy reading everyday and I can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight .,1
"This is a great tablet, perfect size, and works very fast.",1
this is the best tablet out there.....great bang for your buck,1
"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price.",1
great,1
"These are great batteries for the price. I purchased these batteries for my son, who loves listening to books on the Play-Away pods from the library. They seem to last the same amount of time as any name brand battery. I will be buying these again the future.",1
"Yay, a good value and now I have a big stock of batteries available when I need them.",1
My nephew is so happy to have his own tablet. Works pretty good.,1
"This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet.",1
This tablet works great but the only down fall is often times it slows down. Other than that great tablet for children at a good price.,1
So great for the perfect price,1
I have been using Amazon Basics products for about 2 years and have always found them to be first rate. The batteries last as long as the name brand batteries and cost a lot less.,1
This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it..,1
5 Stars,1
Seem to work fine.,1
"The Amazon Echo is a really fun thing to play with. We always try to find new things to say to it which would make it say something funny.The Echo has been the most helpful in our home for creating shopping lists for everyone in the house with a phone. If any of us find ourselves at the store, we know what the others want. Shopping on Amazon is really easy and fun as well.There's a whole bunch of apps so it won't be hard for you to find what will make the Echo useful to you specifically. We love it. I couldn't recommend it more.",1
"I've been purchasing various sizes of these AmazonBasics batteries for a while now, they're a great value in comparison to other brands. We are often using these in fairly mundane ways---remote controls, small flashlights, toys---but have also had success with them in game controllers that commonly drain batteries really quickly.One bonus with these AAs: they are shrink-wrapped 4 to a pack within the larger box. This makes it really convenient to toss a 4-pack in a purse, backpack, or glove compartment: no loose batteries rolling all around, and you know all 4 are the same age when you pop open the plastic wrap.",1
"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read.",1
"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one!",1
This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.,1
It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.,0
Good price and long lasting,1
Always a good deal,1
I had used the Kindle Paperwhite for quite awhile before I got intrigued by the Voyage seeing it in person. I was apprehensive about upgrading given the higher cost but it was entirely worth it. The Paperwhite is lite in weight but somehow the Voyage feels weightless. The screen is absolutely beautiful and to me the nicest feature is the screen is flush with the bezel around. Little learning curve to the page press on the side but tweaking the settings a little I have it down now.,1
This was a perfect tablet for my 12 year old. It does everything that she needed it to.,1
As expected,1
Great for ebooks and games also social media times,1
"these tablets work wonders for my needs, i didnt need a tablet to work, only for web browsing and play some games. nothing fancy, this tablet fits perfectly for that. and the price...pff perfect. ! you wont find this quality cheaper.",1
All good,1
This product is a great learning tool for my 4yr old toddler. It's has the option for kid mode or regular tablet mode.,1
My daughter loves it. Parental controls are simple makes it easy when monitoring what my kid is in to,1
"The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7"". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places.",1
Economical way to keep a good supply of batteries on hand.,1
"Cannot beat the price for this Fire HD 8inch tablet--just the right size and during Black Friday, it was less than $50. Graphics are superb, tablet very easy to use.",1
I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking,0
I only buy my batteries from Amazon. They are inexpensive and last a long time! Super impressed with their quality of batteries.,1
"Don't know why I waited so long to finally invest in rechargeable batteries. Once you switch, you won't go back!",1
Just as good as Energizer,1
Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature,1
Batteries are fine. They are energetically active and power things up like I like.,1
This amazon tablet is perfect for first time users. Easy to operate even for a 3 year old.,1
Thanks for the batteries Amazon! Now my battery operated lights and fans will work when I loose power!,1
"I previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom. She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also.",1
Great price!,1
"My kiddo loves this tablet. She's 1 1/2 and knows how to work it well. I look at it sometimes and see apps that I didn't download! Lol Good thing, first year is free. It's very durable as well. Great product overall. I would've liked a different color for her, but blue was all that was in stock and I got it a great price being on sale plus I had certificates to use.",1
"Seem to work as well as the big brands at half the cost, no brainer buy. I'm about to get the AAA batteries.",1
Excellent quality and durability for a young child,1
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!,1
"Delight your child with books, games and shows tailored just for him on this Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition tablet. The 8-inch high-definition display offers immersive play or viewing, and a parental dashboard lets you set up appropriate content or time limits. This Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition tablet comes with a durable case that resists damage.",1
These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell AA in my small Christmas light strings and they last me 2.5-3 weeks with being constantly on. These have lasted about 4 days with the same use. I read other reviews which stated they were the same but it wasn't until I put them in my normal light strings that I saw the difference. Will NOT order again.,-1
Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...,1
Disappointed by the amount of time these batteries lasted.,-1
Same for these AA batteries as for the AAA batteries.,1
Buen producto.,1
This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.,-1
Got it for my son and he loves it! Definitely would recommend it!,1
Very good so far,1
"I purchased these batteries hoping they could hold their own amongst my other portable powered devices. Low and behold, I put these in a talking teddy bear and it proceeded to beat up the Energizer powered bunny in my house. I was very thankful for that because the darn rabbit's constant drum beating was driving me insane. After the bunny crawled away from the brawl bruised and defeated, the bear gave me a thumbs up and has protected me ever since. Thank you for these batteries Amazon, they have changed my life.",1
I love getting these batteries delivered through subscribe and save. I'm never out of batteries anymore. It was a constant battle with my family to hunt down batteries and to remember to buy them at the store. They also seem to be long lasting.,1
Good batteries. As good as any major label. Lasts long.,1
Seem O.K.Jim G,1
"These are very good batteries at a good price. That aside, I contacted Amazon about my last set purchased, having seven batteries missing and the customer service promptly sent me a set to replace them quite quickly.It's impossible to have things go perfectly every time, and a lot can be realized by how a company handles things when problems surface. This couldn't have been handled any better.",1
"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels",1
"I love my amazon fire tablet, I'm sure my kids will love theirs too!",1
Great price and can't tell a difference between these and more expensive brands. I buy again and again in every size :),1
Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder,1
Great price for these alkaline batteries. Being that they are AAA there is not much of a power drain for devices like remote control. I found that the AA amazon basic batteries will not last as long as as you named brand alkaline batteries.,0
Great so far. Let's see how long they last.,1
"Perfect for reading but also has many other functions. Downloaded my favorite games & travel apps. Set up easy. So far, works great.",1
"Easy to use, fast, sleek and battery holds good charge , happy with it",1
"These are great batteries for the price. I purchased these batteries for my son, who loves listening to books on the Play-Away pods from the library. They seem to last the same amount of time as any name brand battery. I will be buying these again the future.",1
I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price.,1
good buy,1
Is an awesome tablet with plenty of features that made for a perfect gift.,1
Was ok till it fell off table landed flat face down the broke screen my granddaughter threw unit and didn't break but it fell then broke so what good is bumper on unit if that happens,1
"Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service.....",1
"We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well......",1
"These batteries get the job done for a reasonable price. While I haven't done extensive comparative testing, these seem to last about as long as the typical name brands.",1
I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.,1
This is as good of a glove as you will find for the money. Be aware the when ordering they are extremely small if you normally wear a large an extra large will still be tight and need some break in time. Order at least one size bigger,1
"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need",1
"Screen size is good, graphics great. Just got set up and still getting used to it.",1
"This is great for kids, it grows up with them, all the apps are good. My kid loves it",1
"I've used theses batteries in several devices now, and they always run out of juice much faster than typical AA batteries.",-1
My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,1
Works great and as good as more expensive brands for a heck of a lot better price/,1
This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.,1
This is my 2nd time purchasing these batteries. They last as long as any other brand. I will continue to buy these. I have also started my office buying these.,1
hard to find a better deal then this,1
I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.,1
They're batteries. They make small devices work. What more is there to say,1
"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts...",1
holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had,1
These batteries work just as well as the ones you get at the store. They last and you don't have to go get dressed and waste gas to get them. The price is fantastic as well!,1
As this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but I will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the Kindle intact. I am very happy with this purchase as is the child. Not to heavy and she can hold it with no problem.,1
Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does.,1
I love it he is three and does everything on it so many learning games he likes to play he does amazing with it,1
"No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great",1
Both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that I bought one for each,1
Brought it for my niece for a Christmas and she loves it doesn't lag or anything it works just fine,1
They're just batteries but they work and for a great price,1
Great purchase.,1
Best deal in town.,1
Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).,1
Several batteries don't work.,-1
Keeps the remote for the TV working so my lazy butt does not have to get up and manually change channels!,1
good,1
Never disappointed.,1
didn't seem to last very long.,1
This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!,1
"i now use AA and AAA amazon batteries, great price, same quality as name brands.",1
Lasted half the time as duracell in the same product,0
The kindle e-readers are the best on the market. While this one doesn't include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version.,1
I have the Echo and bought this one for the bedroom. Great alarm clock.,1
My mom loves it for reading. My mom is not tech savvy but she was able to adapt pretty quickly.,1
"Great tablet, not for the power user. Average users will find everything they need.",1
Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!,1
"A great buy for consumable, everyday batteries!RayB",1
"We got these for our TV remote. We didn't need such a large package, but it was the cheapest option, so we went ahead and purchased the 20 pack. It was great to be able to save money over the name brands, and since it was Amazon brand, we figured they would be good quality (and we were right). It was also awesome to be able to get them in 2 days, since our TV buttons are very hard to use so the shorter time without a remote, the better!Work great. Probably won't run out of AAA anytime soon, but would consider buying other sizes when needed.",1
I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now,1
"I bought this for my dad, I buy Anker for all my cable and power needs, and once again, they did not disappoint. This is a must buy!!!!",1
"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing.",-1
"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far.",1
received quickly but haven't seen how long they last compared to more expensive batteries,1
I love this product so far. No issues so far. Will shop again.,1
The kids love it and are always on it. Would recommend to anyone.,1
Good,1
much better than buying at the grocery store and the last longer.,1
Don't last nearly as long as major brands.,-1
"So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!",1
"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work",1
This are so much better then the Copper top and the Bunny Batteries. I use to buy mine off the bid board site. I started seeing new copper top leaking with a exp date of 2020. I ordered this and I'm hooked. This is my new supplier of Batteries.,1
"Can't beat for price,feels expensive but isn't. Does all the basics",1
"Not universal. Did not work on garage door opener, given as gift but now cannot return.",-1
Decent price and performance out of these AAA batteries.,1
You can never have enough good batteries on hand !,1
"I've bought a lot of AmazonBasics batteries, and nearly all of them have been more than half dead on arrival. My remote controls won't even work with the brand new batteries in place. I won't be buying these again.",-1
I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.,1
my daughter enjoys her tablet reading the books for school & screen size is prefect,1
"These batteries are nothing special. They do the job, probably not as good as some name brands but good enough for my wireless trackball.",0
"Great batteries at a reasonable price. These seem to last as long if not longer than your other name brands. I use these in toys, remote controls and other devices around the house, and haven't had any issues at all.",1
"These batteries work as desired, If I'm not using rechargeable batteries I always use the AmazonBasics.",1
Great product at a nice price.,1
As advertised.,1
good price,1
Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.,1
My daughter loves this tablet hard to get her to put it down. Strong battery and a full tablet for her as she ages,1
As expected.,1
"Works great and cheaper than at big box stores! We have lots of frameless candles, so these are great",1
"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity.",-1
This tablet is great for games and music. My son enjoys playing games and music on this device.,1
It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.,1
Better than name brands,1
Easy to use. Gift for 86 year old mom who loves to read. She needed a bigger screen. Will enjoy other abilities of tablet.,1
High quality batteries,1
"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs.",-1
My grandson has thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to use. He frequently sends us messages and pictures.,1
"Excellent product, exactly what I was looking for. No issues.",1
Great product,1
"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!",1
I love this tablet! I was not sure if I would like the screen size but it is just fine.,1
Bought this during the Black Friday deal.A decent and a good tablet for the price of 50 bucks.,1
Great device. Travels well. Easy to navigate. Would recommend.,1
Batteries popped open inside the motion detector lights making a mess and ruining the detector. I will never buy this brand again.,-1
"They last a long time, have a good value, and are delivered to my door. I really can't complain.",1
"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text.",1
"Very good performance and long lasting at a better than the dollar store price. I use AmazonBasics in a laser pointer at least twice daily for about twenty minutes a day. My dog is high energy and we live in an area where the weather is yucky and inclement. Yes, I know you aren't supposed to use a laser with dogs (I found that out 2 years too late). But that is the only way my dog can get enough exercise and not drive me crazy. I use to good through batteries like crazy. That being said, I have tried the better brands and AmazonBasics batteries and these seem to be superior in duration and very affordable.",1
Work just as good as the name brands out there.,1
"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users.",1
They put out power. The price was good.,1
They're batteries...what more can you say Great price.,1
"For my 3-year-old, it serves it purpose and very cost effective.",1
I can‚Äôt find earphones for my Amazon fire 7th.xxxx,1
My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!,1
A lot of batteries at a good price. They work. No problems.,1
Good tablet for kids. This has a great interface as well.,1
"I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one.",1
"Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc.",1
"Everything you want in a tablet. Size is good, price is great.",1
The KINDLE VOYAGE is a wonderful product and I use it everyday for my reading. I take it to lunch and dinner each day.,1
"Just as good as Duracell, if not better. Do you beg to differ Here is an experiment to conduct for a school child. Use a Duracell and an Amazon to light up two light bulbs and see how long each one stays lit. Then divide: (hours lit)/(cost of battery) and see which one is the better value. I already changed out one Amazon AA in my wireless mouse and another 2 AA batteries in my wireless weather station. The mouse Amazon AA lasted about a month and a half and the weather station is still running after 3 weeks. The batteries came wrapped in packs of 4.",1
Worked as expected.,1
"What can I say, it's a battery",1
good,1
Great product as a great price,1
I highly recommend this product for children with special needs,1
"Easy to navigate, I love it despite the charging port. Charging port doesn't last very long though. Just purchased my second one.",1
Stocked-up,1
The kids love it and are always on it. Would recommend to anyone.,1
I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product,1
Came charged and the right size what more could you want,1
Works great! Prepare to be grossed out by what's hiding in there...,1
they're batteries,1
Easier than going to the store,1
good job,1
"i am ready to do a full review on this product.Sins the package arrived in my house, i immediately take 2 aa battery and put it to my mac mouse,believe me mac mouse is 24/7 in use and it got me thru for 1 month and 1 week FEB / 19 - MAR / 25-26really good product",1
Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.,1
Great deal! Amazon is a brand I have come to trust.,1
I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased,1
the device works flawlessly... nearly indestructable for a 2 yr old... also comes with a no questions asked replacement policy through Amazon in the event that the screen breaks or something crazy,1
Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew for his birthday. He had been asking for a tablet forever. I made his day! He loves his tablet. All he's does is watch you tube and play games,1
They work.,1
Love love love.,1
More batteries for less money. That's what I'm talking about.,1
Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.,1
"My kiddo loves this tablet. She's 1 1/2 and knows how to work it well. I look at it sometimes and see apps that I didn't download! Lol Good thing, first year is free. It's very durable as well. Great product overall. I would've liked a different color for her, but blue was all that was in stock and I got it a great price being on sale plus I had certificates to use.",1
Sadly these batteries are horrible! I hardly ever have complaints about anything I order but these batteries barely have any power and I've had to change them out many times.,-1
these batteries do not perform as good as the cheapest ones on the market.,-1
Hands down better than the top brands. Thank you Amazon.,1
"Great little lap top with touch screen, absolutely ruins you.",1
Bought it as a gift for my aunt. She says that she loves it uses it everyday! Does a lot more than her old Kindle.,1
"It is better than in thought it was. At first I didnt like how small the screen was, but then the conistent reading, it got much better. After a month i it grew on me.",1
I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.,1
I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.,1
"The apps are better, it charges faster and the camera is really neat!",1
These came on time and work as expected.,1
Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use,1
Got these for the price point - rechargeables don't hold up as well or long as I'd like - really hate disposables but until the make a Nuclear AA battery that runs for 25 years or longer and costs under 5 these will have to do. Yet to see if they last as long as the higher price Bunnies.,1
"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!",1
Really great product. Tons of batteries and for super cheap. I haven't had any of these die on me yet but even if they last only half of other brands it's still a really great buy. Super happy.,1
"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel",1
I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.,1
"Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it's something new! But that didn't last long.",1
"When I bought this it was to use for reading, but it‚Äôs also a great tablet. Download apps, surf the net and more.",1
Junk - after trying 10 batteries one worked!,-1
So far they seem to last as long as the top brands for a lot less money! I will definitely continue to order these batteries!,1
"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again.",-1
Kid proof and works well!! There are plenty of apps too!,1
Thanks perfect for my little kids they love this tablet good quality and fast enough for them,1
"Disappointed... In my handheld Microsoft wireless game controller these last about 1 week. Duracell/Energizers last 3-4 weeks... Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Prime. Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell. DON'T PUT THESE IN ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE... like smoke detectors, emergency flashlights and radios.",-1
I was surprised how much I like my new tablet. It is better than my previous tablet.,1
Great value for the money.,1
This tablet is great for kids. It has so many apps and videos that can be downloaded. It has a nice size screen as well. The only thing I don't like is the charger.,1
"Easy to use, loves the green case and durable. Great gift.",1
I love how you can keep up with social media and watch movies online. This is fantastic!!!,1
Good batteries to buy in bulk. We have security lights that eat batteries so it's nice to have a supply on hand.,1
"Great first tablet for 6 year old, purchased with a slicone case for protection. Best Buy had great holiday pricing.",1
Great service I loved all of the items and were great gifts,1
"Amazon does a good job with these batteries. When you have young kids and lots of electronics, buying in bulk and buying quality is key.",1
"Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight",1
Does not last as long as name brands such as Duracell and Energizer.,0
"Bought this for my four year old nephew and he loves it! He has dropped it several times, because of the hard shell case nothing happened. He is able to manipulate all educational games and has no problem with any operations.",1
work like a charm and the price it's very affordable.,1
Amazon never ceases to amaze me...maybe thats why i ONLY shop on here! Thee batteries have great life and price. Bye bye duracell or energizer!,1
It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids,1
Bought this to use on my travels. comes in handy surfing the web.,1
Worst batteries ever....they work once and drain out...you try to use something again and the battery is dead!,-1
Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly,1
"BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Fits the MacAir 11.6 perfect. The Amazon sleeve is simply neoprene, which snags and has so much friction, it doesn't easily slide in/out of my backpack. The Amazon quality is decent, but looks like a beer can cozy (koozie) compared to the CASE LOGIC. The CASE LOGIC IS NOT just NEOPRENE! It is highly protective, light, low density foam encased in canvas. It's more durable and slide in and out of my backpack better. Also the CASE LOGIC opens on two sides not just a slit on one side like the Amazon.(I bought both, and tried to return the AmazonBasics, yet Amazon was going to charge me 8.34 to send it back.. so i am keeping it.. Don't waste your time.. Don't make my mistake, buy the CASE LOGIC ELS-111 11 (note: last photo of Case Logic sleeve)",0
This is a low cost tablet. It offers many of the same features as higher priced tablets. Good buy!,1
Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display.,1
"I like how they are organized in the box into packs of 4. The box further separates them into groups and great to keep for storing them in. Batteries seem to work just fine. PLUS, they is cheap.",1
"Good for kids, it‚Äôs no iPad but can‚Äôt beat it for the price",1
My son love it. He watch his favorite cartoon shows and love to read books,1
"Great for the kids, and has a good battery for how much they use it",1
Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage.,1
great/solid product. last as much as leading brands,1
"Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound.",1
Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.,1
This has the all speed and storage I needed for my preschooler. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.,1
Overall a good First Tablet for a Child. I find it difficult to find a specific game on the Child User. The Adult User has a search feature. Not sure where the Search feature is on the Child User. My 5 yr old Grandson is enjoying the Tablet.,1
"Out of the box there really is nothing to do but plug it in to the USB drive and you're ready to go. You get a pop up reminder asking if you want to use the drive as a back up. If you select yes or no that will be the last time you see it. If you say ""decide later"" it will come up each time you plug it in to the USB drive.",1
They work!,1
These batteries work as expected. No noticeable difference in the mAh,1
Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected.,1
"Excellent price and they last for a long time. Have not had one leak either, like the other brand I use to use.",1
"I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that.",1
excellent!,1
good battery life and pays to buy in bulk,1
"My daughter loves her new kindle, now she can pick from hundreds of books.",1
Great value!!,1
"just got em so I can't really comment on how good the do the job, good price, quick delivery but have only put two into one of my keyboards but they can go up to a year so who can say after three days",1
I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one,1
"This is my second batch. These batteries are perfect for what I needed. In my experience, they seem to be just as good as the more expensive name brands.",1
This table this the perfect size.I can carry it any where.,1
The best reader from Kindle and I can surf the web as well.,1
"Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices.",1
"As of this writing, I've been using these for over a year and have yet to experience any problems or issues related to dead batteries or battery life.I use a battery tester, and randomly measured a few, new, out of the box, and they all rated at 100. Happy with these batteries.",1
"I have the Amazon Tap (which I purchased at Best Buy about a month ago) and love it so much I bought one for my son and his family. They love it, too!",1
I bought this for my 21 month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it. What a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time. Thanks,1
Nice quality and friendly packaging... besides a great price :),1
Good price!,1
These batteries are reasonably priced but I found they do not last as long as other batteries,0
"Was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. This was on sale and had good reviews. After consulting with the sales associate with some questions, I decided to purchase item. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!",-1
"For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon.",1
"I love Best Buy; I wouldn't think of going elsewhere for my electronics. I don't believe their prices can be beat, and they stand behind their products.",1
Super cheap and they work.,1
"The best buy anywhere, this is the only place we get our batteries.",1
they need to be change to offen,-1
Dad loves it. A little bigger than his last. Way better picture. Good camera. Easy to set up.,1
While it isn't the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do. It gets on the social media sites and the internet. If you're expecting more from yoru tablet then don't look for one at this price. You'll need the more powerful ones that translate to bigger price tags. I've watched movies on this from my Amazon prime account and have read my books from my Kindle account and everything works well. It's not at lightening speed but it does get there in a timely manner!,1
Great Product,1
Good price. Shipped fast.,0
"This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases!",1
For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem,0
"Great pad to give the little ones a headstart to the world of tech. Very sturdy cover, nice size for little hands to grip. Very reasonable price. Great buy !!",1
my daughter enjoys her tablet reading the books for school & screen size is prefect,1
good deal,1
Work just fine,1
This is my second time buying Amazon brand batteries. My son is an avid gamer so he eats batteries like crazy!! You can beat these batteries. They are a great price and last just as long as the name brand! I'll buy again and again!,1
"We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!",1
"Downloaded movies for my son to watch and the audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it",-1
I love being able to check my email or the weather. I haven't read a book on it yet but I can. Love it.,1
GREAT QUALITY GREAT PRICE,1
i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.,1
"Excellent cells for the price range. From what I see, they are as good as Duracells and that is all I ever used to use.The packaging is amazing. Only in China can they still pack in cardboard boxes that surround the package like this.I am not doing any testing, other than use in low powered items like wireless mice, keyboards, wall clocks and the like. That's all I need them for. These cells meet those requirements and that's all I care about. For high volume stuff I use NiMHs, but you just can't beat the price. I am finding that many of the Amazon basics products are a hit. I have bought several things and all have worked just as good or better than the higher priced competition. Good job Amazon.",1
Seem to hold up as well as any name brand and at a much better price,1
good,1
These are great for the money and seem to last as long as the other brands,1
big pack of batteries...work well :),1
Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with,1
Batteries don't last long at all.,0
You couldn't get a better buy for $59 than the Amazon fire 7. Paid the extra $20 to get the 16gb. Well worth it.,1
"Bought it as a gift, the wife loves it more than her iPad",1
Batteries work good. Nice to have a bunch around for the kids toys.,1
"I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it.",1
Makes reading outdoors enjoyable and I spend more time at the beach!,1
good value!,1
Bought it for a gift. I do not know what else to say!,1
Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.,1
Nice and convenient just wish that it came with written directions so that I could brighten up the screen.,1
The amazon fire tablet is easy to use and set-up great tablet.,1
I love my amazon fire. This is the best product I've ever bought. I can get any books I want for way cheaper than they are on store.,1
"I love my kindle for reading over my iPad now. Best buy gave me a good deal on this kindle, and fast and friendly service. This kindle is easy on my sensitive eyes and a pleasure to hold. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an e-reader.",1
Satisfied with the AAA batteries from Amazon.,1
Excellent price.,1
Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!,1
If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality,1
These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk,-1
This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.,1
No issues. Long lasting,1
They're batteries and they work.,1
My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She,1
Have owned IOS products as long as I can remember. Not on same level,-1
As good or better than any major brand out there.The price is a fraction of what the major brands are.Time will tell what the durability is.This proves what a rip off battery prices are from the major brand manufacturers.,1
Great batteries. Thank you.,1
I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.,1
"Given its price, probably makes sense but doesn't last very long even with lower power usage or lesser used devices. I'd spend few dollars more and buy Duracell pack from Costco.",-1
I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet,1
"These were so cheap, but they work just as well as name brand batteries. Come in a cardboard box which is so much easier for storage than those cardboard and plastic things",1
Love my kindle! At the price it is the best value in tech right now!,1
No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9,0
Amazon fire tablet is an outstanding piece of equipment. Strongly recommend.,1
"Does not last as long as the bunny or copper top, but adequate.",1
my granddaughter has learned a lot of educational things on hers,1
Surprisingly they last!!!,1
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle,1
"So this is the seventh or eighth kindle I own. It has a readable and backlit interface that light doesn‚Äôt disrupt. It isn‚Äôt the fastest web browser ever, but it does all things kindle very well. At Christmas prices you really can‚Äôt go wrong with this little tablet. Love!",1
"High quality, power and long lasting",1
So it is working great. She loves the learning games,1
took WAY to long to receive. and then some were corroded.,-1
"Durable case, easy to use. My grandkids watch nursery rhymes and play educational games. I've seen the youngest stand on the Fire and it is still perfect",1
Great item,1
"Really good deal, the batteries are high quality too.",1
My granddaughter loved it. She used it for her school work.,1
The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.,-1
I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.,1
This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it.,1
Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.,1
Broke about a month after ordering them.,-1
My little girl loves her Kindle. I'm so happy I bought an upgrade to her previous kindle. Best Christmas gift ever.,1
The only draw back to this device is no internet service included. My 1 year old granddaugther loves hers and I don't leave home without it.,1
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.,1
Love it!,1
This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.,1
This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it's my 3rd one.,1
Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.,1
works fine.,1
"I"" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok",1
"Purchased as a gift, the recipient is very happy and surprised with the performance, thinking of buying another one for myself.",1
Good to use it to read books under light.the price is lower than other website.,1
"Great bargain, long lasting",1
Office purchase,1
"Pros: Got it for under 50, much impressive sound than 2nd gen. Has every other functionality. Cons: May be not trendy looking as newer, but still sets well on my kitchen island",1
This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.,1
they are fresh batteries and work great,1
Great value !,1
Works great - good product good quality,1
"no problems,arrived quickly",1
Great quality,1
Works great with wireless mics.,1
"I am just speechless with these batteries. They are probably the best deal for good quality batteries you will ever find. I feel like they should cost more because they are really good and last a long time. In a way, I feel like they can compete with Duracell batteries.",1
"A nice complement to the Alexa family. The sound quality is nearly as good as the original Echo, and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by, particularly for the price.",1
"like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product",0
"I really haven't had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget.",1
Great buy!!!!,1
These are a great deal for the price. It always comes in handy to have extra batteries around.,1
"So, I saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for 48 of this alkaline batteries. Yeah, well, NOW I am startled by how long they last. Uh-oh, make that DON'T last. I don't take but 20 to 30 shots from my little Finepix camera before the lens starts closing when I try to shoot. Compare that to...well, I'm not gonna lie. I never counted, but I took TONS of shots using Duracell alkaline bats. Conservative estimate At least 300 shots for each set of two. Einstein not needed to do the math on that. I just looked and see that they are made in Indonesia, which may or may not matter, since I don't know where Duracells are made. I still have 34 of these lousy things left. Ticks me off, royally!!!(Now, let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase.",-1
Excellent Amazon fire HD for kids. Perfect for a holiday gift,1
EXCELLENT,1
Good batteries,1
Okay,1
My kids love the tablet and it's easy for them to use,1
these were dead on arrival,-1
These are batteries. They power things.,1
"The kids tablet made a good gift for our youngest grandson, 6 years of age.",1
"This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!",1
Good price. Batteries all work and last just like name brand,1
"My 3 1/2 year old grandson son LOVES this ""big game"" as he calls it.",1
excellent!,1
Work great,1
Great price and they work very well will continue to buy these amazon batteries compared to the other brands in the future. Loved to save money and the work the same as the other competitors.,1
"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far.",1
Excellent entertainment for children. Very controlled content.,1
A1,1
"What can be said. For the sale price of $50.00 this was a great purchase. Not a high end tablet but for ebooks, movies, email and web browsing I have no complaints.",1
"You get what you pay for here. These are cheap batteries and don't last very long, I'd spend the extra and get rechargeables.",-1
"Great purchase, value and quality!",1
Work great,1
Great!,1
The lights seem to work real well. I have not used them for long put they are plenty bright enough for the closet I'm using them in.,1
"Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate.",1
Drain quick,-1
My daughter love it she don't really brother me it keep her so busy,1
"Probably should have rated these one star, but I didn't because I like Amazon as a whole. These batteries are soooo bad though! They were comparable to the Kirkland ones at Costco in price so I decided to switch things up and try these out. Huge mistake. These last half the life of Kirkland's. Not kidding. Not worth it. These are cheap!!!!!!!!",-1
Our children tend to forget to get gentle with the kindle so the replacement plan is great. And I don't have to worry about the wrong kind of content popping up. It's a relief.,1
works well with my baby's toys. good price!,1
worked,1
So far so good testing fully charged,1
"They keep busy, lots of kids apps to view!! Entertainig",1
Quality batteries for a fraction of the price of others,1
I bought this tablet to replace another one I had that ran to slow and had barely any storage space and so far so good! I've been using it for a few hours everyday for about a week and haven't had to recharge yet! The tablet runs quickly opening browsers and apps. It has more storage than my other tablet and has an SD card port. Even though it's an 8in screen it does it feel like it because the pictures are so vivid. So far the only thing I don't like is that you can't mirror or cast it to a TV or computer screen. Other than that it seems to work great.,1
great product very happy with the purchase.,1
These seem to work just as well as the expensive name brands. I will only buy these from now on.,1
the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os,1
Good.,1
"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.",1
I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .,-1
"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so.",-1
Well i am a fan of the Amazon Basic items. They are life saver for me.I don't have much to say as Amazon basic quality and economy prices are well know to everyone.Thank you Amazon for the Amazon Basic items.,1
use these bad boys on my xbox controllers. last as long as any other batteries I've purchased,1
I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.,1
"Fast shipping. I haven't worn out one yet, so I dont know what their life will be, but they look good.",1
Bought this for my Granddaughter's 10th birthday. She LOVES it!!! The protective case it is in is AWESOME and the perfect pink for a girl!,1
"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money.",1
"Batteries can be expensive! However, Amazon has taken the opportunity to sell a good quality product. There are plenty of batteries for the cost, and in these times of uncertainty we need to be prepared for our family. During times of power outage batteries are so comforting because they allow us to maintain a sense comfort. They also sell these in triple a, c, and d. The price is good compared to other brands, and the quality of Amazon is backing the product. Safe and good buy for any consumer.",1
They seem to not last as long as other brands. Great Price though,0
So many batteries and they last a decent amount of time. Such a better price than going to the store!,1
great buy,1
Great buy!,1
"UI is not smooth, it flickers sometimes. Overall a thumbs up from me",1
"bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this.",1
I have a simple electronic keypad I use these batteries in. With the name brand I would go about 2 months. With the amazon brand i go 2 weeks. Not sure I am sold on this being an equivalent battery just yet.,0
"Got this for my 5 year old daughter and her and my three year old love it! Lightweight, durable and loaded with books and games. What really sold me on this one over the other options was the 2 year anything guarantee that Amazon offers!",1
Nice Battery pack. For a whole lot less than the leading brands.,1
This tablet is very good for my daughter of age five.,1
Batteries seems to last as long as top brand names and the price is phenomenal. I use a lot of the Amazon Basics product s and have been happy with all of them.,1
Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.,1
As advertised and expected.,1
It's batteries what more can I say,1
Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.,1
"Rugged, good quality, many games to play and beginner books to read. My 5 yr old grand daughter absolutely loves it!",1
Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games,1
Work great.,1
"Great price, lets see long they hold a charge.",1
This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.,1
"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",1
"Good batteries, just as great as name brand but for a cheaper price",1
Kindle fire is a good product. I am happy with my purchase. The only difficulty was buying books. It was difficult to understand initially.,1
"Great deal, they last pretty long",1
Came in one piece looks great but haven't used it.,1
I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great,1
Its OK. Not much life in the batteries.,0
"Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc.",1
In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price,1
Very pleased with product. I was also a decent price and not overpriced.,1
The tablet is great the jacket not so much - doesn't stand up - hate it,1
great,1
These batteries don't last long. Waste of money.,-1
We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.,1
I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix,1
Love these batteries.,1
User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can't complain.,1
Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.,1
works awesome and can get them on good sales!,1
Just love my Kindle. Easy to use and carry around and more books to purchase!!!!!,1
"I like the size and quick connection, but sometimes App store can't find the items I look for.",1
Strong batteries!,1
"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app",0
great for the price and last as long as other name brand batteries,1
I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.,1
I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.,1
"Bought these for a couple of baby toys, and so far, they have worked great. They are much cheaper compared to other popular brands!",1
"Easy to carry; easy to read. Easy to get books and download. Nice to have a dictionary within your book. Able to download books, newspapers or magazines.",1
They work and a good price,1
Good. Can't really say anything bad about the AmazonBasic line of products. They just work and are usually cheaper than other alternatives.,1
I have bought this for my niece. She loves reading the story books in the Kindle. I am happy to gift this.,1
I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.,1
If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!.,1
"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas.",-1
i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service.,1
"Bought this for my son, it's been through some stuff and still going strong",1
Great product easy to use. My niece loves it won't put it down.,1
if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside .,1
It's worth the price to avoid big box stores.,1
"My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a ""kid proof"" case.",1
"Its a good tablet. Fast, durable and easy to use. I especially love the parental features that are available. I am more of a fan of android tablets but for a little toodler this is far better.",1
"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts...",1
"Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members.",1
Don't last very long.,0
"Works perfectly, I'm interested to see how they hold up over time.",1
Excellent price for these batteries.,1
Wrong size!! Just awful. Not worth money,-1
Great value,1
"not much to say about batteries, they do their job and seem to last a good amount of time. I like the price!",1
"Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games.",1
"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",-1
Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho,0
I love the tablet....I just can't do without the tabelt,1
These work as well or better than name-brand batteries. Anyone with kids knows the batteries end up costing as much as the toy after replacing them multiple times. I buy them in bulk in all sizes.,1
Power,1
One of my all-time favorite coffee flavors. Extremely smooth with no tangy aftertaste.,1
"Good tablet for Amazon lovers, not so good for Android lovers.Too much Amazon advertising ad nauseum.. Can't get Google Play apps. Miss google. Returned to store.thanks",0
This is the right size to carry around. Really like this Tablet.....,1
Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!,1
just trying,1
Great price,1
"Marginal performance at best. Used one in my Turbo razor, and it died much earlier than other brands. It also dies quickly, with a steep power drop-off.",-1
"AAA alkaline Amazon batteries, they have a good price and seems to be working well, I will buy them again.",1
Got it for my son and he loves it! Definitely would recommend it!,1
"Quality batteries, great price. Perfect buy for a household with toddlers. Also the packaging is great-easy to keep the new batteries in and use when needed. No loose batteries rolling around everywhere once you open it.",1
This is a great Tablet for the kid's if you don't want to spend the money for a better brand.,1
Cant beat these batteries.,1
"These batteries are every bit as good as the name brands, at a very nice price. Will order again for sure.",1
This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!,1
"What can you say, they're batteries.",1
Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value.,1
"I love it! I got it for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and now my husband wants one so I'll be purchasing another one. It's just the right size, we love it.",1
I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date.,1
just batteries.,1
I ordered a ton of these for holiday candle lights. They are in for 6 hours each night and turn off on a timer. We are 15 days in and every single candle (34 of them) is so dim you can barely see them.Expected to get far more life out of these. Do not recommend.,-1
Great package.,1
Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it,1
seem fine. great price. I will buy again.,1
I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips.,1
"Wow! it is so nice to have a light and easy to hold device that only carries tons of books! No distractions like on my iPad, with email messages pinging in and facebook updates to check...just books and lots of them!The Kindle Voyage is everything they said it would be...light, back lit with self adjusting levels, page turners, all the bells and whistles. I am so glad I waited and splurged for this one!",1
"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.",0
"Not the best tablet, but it does the basics for an awesome price!",1
"My son loves it! So many great games, audiobooks and apps for kids, and we love the timer feature so we can set time for him to let him play before bedtime. Very worth it!",1
The technology just keeps getting better and better,1
"Shame on Amazon for putting their trusted name on this garbage! Nothing I put these batteries work properly whether AA, AAA, C or D, not the blood pressure cup won't fill with air before going into Error, motion lights that flicker when these are put in, remotes that work on and off - which all goes away with name brand batteries!",-1
This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account.,1
My granddaughter loved it. She used it for her school work.,1
Not bad. They do the job and so far so good.,1
i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service.,1
Very happy with them. Work as well as name brand ones that are twice the price.,1
Bought 2 of these tablets for my kids. They love them and easy to use.,1
Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.,1
"The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge.",1
Good price. They works.,1
You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.,1
Affordable and usable.,1
This Kindle is exactly what my wife wanted and has worked out wonderfully.,1
"My daughter loves it, except that she can't connect to her chromecast",1
Kindle fire is extremely easy to use. The protective foam layer is awesome.,1
Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet.,1
"I needed some and the price is good! Liked the packaging...they don't all roll out when opened at one end (no so with some of the normal name brands)! Seem to be lasting as long as the other brands (but I will let you know if that statement changes).Amazon is a good brand. I'll reorder when I need more!Yep, I recommend this product",1
Fast delivery of product as advertised.,1
Thanks great product,1
Not as good as name brand but worth the price.,1
"The flush bezel and display are a huge improvement. The text is crisp and easy on the eyes. The page press function and inclusion/position of the touch sensors is perfect. The price seems a bit high for something as simple as an E-Reader, but if you love to read this is a must have. You will not be disappointed.",1
"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long.",-1
i cant at night it has no back light from one to ten its a 7,-1
Was a gift for our 8 year old daughter. Great for kids,1
Truly amazing combination of portability and ease of use and good sound.,1
great deal,1
I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things.,1
"I love this product. the screen is bigger, the bumper is stringer and my granddaughter loves it...so that's all that matters.",1
"Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics.",1
lot's oh power,1
I purchased the Kids kindle because of the warranty plan. Thinking it's the best deal for the money. I find it in no way user friendly for my ha me or my 3 year old granddaughter! She can take my iPad go strength to her folder.,-1
"I liked it so much I got 2 and the battery life is amazing. I will buy more when ever they go on sale I have 8 grandkids, these would be perfect for them.",1
Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it.,1
For the price this does a lot. Purchased as a gift for my mother who is in here 70's. She loves that she can play her games and download books to read when ever she wants. Great value.,1
I was very impressed with the packaging of these batteries. They work as well as any of the top commercial AA batteries. I will keep them handy for any future use.,1
This is a great amazon fire tablet for kids highly recommend,1
It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab,0
Very quality,1
"My 5 year old son loves his kindle. He can fully work it himself. We love all the he age appropriate games, learning apps, and books. The case is great for all those accidentally drops.",1
These seem to work as well as any name brand batteries. I'll be ordering more.,1
They learned how to use it very quickly! Great for travelling in the car...reduces boredom!,1
"First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Junk batteries.",-1
Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it,1
Love em.,1
Cheaper than other brands but work just as well. Will buy again!,1
Awful. Have almost gone through a whole box to find a battery or two that actually work.,-1
"Good price, they work, what more can I say",1
These batteries don't last long at all.,-1
It's simple and not difficult for young children to learn. Also is build sturdy in case it does get dropped more than a few times.,1
"I love that this works just like the dot, which I already have 3. However in addition it is portable and has better speaker",1
"Purchased as a gift. It was a good choice. It is as advertised,",1
My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!,1
These batteries have lasted just a long if not longer than the brand name.,1
This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.,1
The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.,1
"Good batteries. Used to buy all my batteries at Sam's Club, but I bought some from Amazon and have switched to Amazons. They take up less space with they way they are packaged versus those at Sam's. The Amazon ones work well. I've gotten duds from Sam's. I'll continue to buy Amazon's.",1
This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle.,1
"I already have the Amazon Echo so this was just an additional one for my office. I think these gadgets are great. Set alarms, timers, get your local weather and who won the game last night. It can do too many things for me to list. It's great for everything however not great for music. I do listen to my local radio station on it - but compared to its' BIGGER brother Echo the sound is not that good.",1
Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge.,1
"My wife's Ipad Mini had issues, she wore it flat out, and wanted to get another one but did not want to spend the money on a new iPad, so we gave this one a try. After BB Reward Zone $ I got it for about $100ish with 32gb of memory.To be clear, this is not on the same level as the iPad mini but it was not designed to. Technical specs not quite as good but for $100ish dollars from a reputable company it is not bad at all. The first thing to note is that it does not come with the ability to download from the Google Play Store. You can can get around this by side loading Google and there are plenty of websites to tell you how to this very easily.My wife has been burning it up with this tablet and she really likes it. She can let go of some of the shortcomings vs the iPad mini. Overall she likes it, which is good.So if you are wanting an inexpensive tablet from reliable company, try the Fire tablet.",1
It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.,1
"Haven't used them, they look fine. Probably overpaid. They arrive in a fancy cardboard box, like they're collectibles or something.",1
Keeps my MagLite functional.,1
Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Keeps her busy for hours.,1
Came as expected. Haven't tested life expectancy yet,0
These work great so far.,1
"poor performer, does not last long at all.",-1
"So far so good. I haven't done any studies on the batteries as others have done, but just from using them they seem to last long and have a good power curve.",1
"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc.",1
"I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use.",-1
"I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!",1
Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.,1
"This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps",1
"I love the 2 cameras, and the video capabilities. I have set up the picture albums and can even share on Facebook and messenger. I like the side charger. Much better than front.I love the size too.",1
"Works great with good storage but, lacks online browsing speed.",1
"Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money",-1
Used them to refill window candles and they are great! Packaged well.,1
Very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability.,1
Not tested so I'm not sure of quality,0
"good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this.",1
This met my expectations and more. My granddaughter loves it. It's user friendly and has unlimited options for her. Would recommend to everyone!,1
great price for so many batteries good quality,1
My youngest daughter is very pleased with this tablet.,1
I went through these like water - stick with Duracell or Energizer.,-1
"Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits.",1
love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service,1
I purchased this tablet for my grandson who is 4 years old. He loves it!,1
"battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint.",1
"I get as good or better performance with these batteries as I do with any name brand batteries, but these are far less expensive, even compared to bulk packages in stores. I use a lot of batteries, so these were a great find! I love that the batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of four, thus making it easy to carry back-up batteries on-the-go. I have purchased these multiple times and will purchase again.",1
"They're a decent value for the amount of batteries (especially on Prime Day) you get. I use them mainly in remotes around the house and other devices, and I haven't had any issues with them leaking. They do drain a little faster than Duracell coppertops, but these are a far better value when caught on sale. I've used both the AA and AAA and they're both decent.",1
These batteries work the same as all the big name brands with a cheaper cost and not having to drive to the store.,1
Got this for my teenage son (17) so that he could give his eyes and neck a rest from looking at media on his iPhone 7+ He totally loved it!,1
Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.,1
"bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this.",1
I bought this tablet as a gift and they really loved it.,1
"I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money.",1
These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity.,-1
"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell. They come close, I think, but definitely not as long. I use AA batteries primarily in my iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, for what it's worth. Still, these amazon batteries are significantly cheaper, so it all probably evens out.",1
"read the reviews, bought this tablet to replace an e-reader. Way more than I expected. Video was better than reviews stated, books load faster than my old one Still getting used to a new OS but I am very pleased",1
"My daughter (4) she loves it. Easy to navigate, hard to break.",1
Arrived and maybe only 1/3 of the batteries actually worked. The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all.,-1
I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.,1
good batteriess,1
My Son Goes Through Double A Batterie and WHEN I Seen This Good Deal i Jumped ON it Theses ARE Great Batteries and WELL Worth it,1
We bought this as a replacement. My daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before Christmas. We love it! Only issues we have is something she does will make it so only half the apps/games show. However we like she can only play safe age appropriate games and don't have to worry when she's on it.,1
Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn't thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one.,1
Very satisfied,1
"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand.",-1
"I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading.",0
"This was a birthday present for my sister, and she had no trouble getting it set up for use. I was happy to find one with 16GB, not an inadequate 8GB. My other purpose in buying it was to test (on a cheap machine, just in case!) a procedure for installing Google's Play Store. That was a success, and I got a Fire HD 10 for myself.",1
The Amazon Fire for Kids is an excellent starter tablet. The supporting games and apps are exceptional. Use of tablet is simple and non-intimidating.,1
not bad for price,1
This is her second Kindle product. she loves the new colors and bigger screen.,1
Batteries. What else can i say,1
Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation,1
Work great. Seems like the life is similar to Duracell. Love the packaging. I'll be ordering more of all the other sizes to stock up.One suggestion for Amazon: print or stamp in big letters all over the little box the batteries come in what size they are.,1
I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet.,1
My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!,1
"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it.",1
Worked great!,1
You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.,1
Great batteries work just as well as other name brands.,1
"Santa got this for my 7year old. Work's great . He plays, games, gets on hulu, and can play his school education learning games. Now he doesn't bother me to use my electronic devices .",1
Bought this tablet for my 84 year old grandpa and he loves it. Easy to use,1
1st kindle screen failed & had to reboot often. Customer Service couldn't fix. Replaced. 2nd one screen reboots often. Customer service offered replace. Just want one that works. Can't get upgrade replacement,-1
No issues. Great for the price.,1
I was excited to see that Amazon was allowing its name to be used on batteries as I feel that Amazon is concerned about its image. Bought these batteries and placed four of them into my camera. Took 2 RAW photos and the batteries are now dead. What a disappointment.,-1
I love amazon basic batteries. I use these in TV remotes and a couple small LED flashlights. They perform just like other budget batteries and last longer in my lights. My battery box is now full of amazon basic batteries.,1
Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.,1
"Batteries are good, duracell might last just a tad bit longer but the price difference is not worth the extra . Kind of hard to review a batteries, but the packaging was easy to open and the batteries were neatly packaged.",1
The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I'm enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift.,1
I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB.,1
I bought them to go into a flashlight. They never lasted more that a few hours and got really dim. maybe good for things like remote controls,-1
Very happy with the purchase. Would recommend to anyone,1
Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone,1
"These are good basic batteries. Probably not ideal for for things that need a high-performance battey, but for flashlights, remotes they are great and competitively priced.",1
As expected,1
"This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product",1
My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .,1
"Best everyday price I have found for high quality AA batteries. I only ever used national brand or Kirkland batteries in the past. These are just as good, at a better everyday price. Yes, I have found batteries on sale to be cheaper, but you have to catch the sale. However, I never seem to run out of batteries when there is a sale. So I stock up on these.",1
"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet.",-1
This is the best Kindle I have ever used. This is way better than the Kindle Fire HD which I also own.,1
Great deal on AAA batteries. I recommend.,1
"Ordered it for a friend so that he could do his bible study, n play games n read books . He loves it",1
They make things go and are cheap.,1
Our 4 grand kids use these daily charge after charge sometimes .youngest is almost 3 oldest is 9 Just watch the charging cable connection easily broken if charging while using,1
Easy tablet to use. Great camera.Touch screen. Very clear screen.,1
"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff.",1
Great batteries for a awesome price. Could not ask for more.,1
"Grandkids like them, ages ranging from 2,8, and 9.",1
Case is well made and fits my WD Passport drive perfectly with enough room for the usb cable.,1
work as name brand,1
my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.,1
"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.",1
"This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """,-1
Was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it,1
So far so good,1
My 5 year daughter really likes this and I can put parental controls on it so I know what she is watching.,1
these batteries are fine and a great deal here on amazon versus purchasing in store,1
Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!,1
It's perfect for me when I'm doing homework or just surfing the web when I'm at a Starbucks or just at home.,1
"The arrived as described and all seem to work great! They were the best price of all the batteries, but are a quality battery.",1
"Not bad, not great. They do as their told.",1
"Their basic AA batteries. I haven't done any detailed tests, but they seem to be working as well as any Alkaline batters we've purchased before. They are a great value as they are much cheaper per battery than any of the other name brands.",1
"If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!",1
"Simple review here, because...they are batteries. Use these all the time and they are great!",1
This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely.,1
Really goo batteries for the price,1
"This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school.",1
It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps,0
I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational.,1
Long lasting and nice. Does not heat up or lose charge while on high heat or very harsh cold temperature. It is also very cheap!,1
so for good,1
Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We've had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal!,1
You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.,1
its a nice tablet for the basic uses i need it for such as apple tv and killing time with games.,1
"Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight",1
My daughter loves her new tablet. Her and my other daughter we're sharing and Samsung tablet but because in such a fan of Amazon I decided to do research and I ended up getting here this one and she loves it. She even said it has more features than her previous one.,1
I bought this for my 3yr old son and it's perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there's so much more for adults as well.. great buy!,1
Works just as well as name brands if not better.,1
"I wanted a device solely for reading and streaming Netflix, no games or other Internet apps. This device is awesome, easy to use, has great battery life and doesn't have as many update or streaming issues as my last device. I highly recommend.",1
Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad,1
Good battery for low price,1
I love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It's fast and light weight. Love it!,1
I loved this Kindle which is even better. It's a gift to a very important friend. Now he is unable to hold a book open with. He says that is easy to read but even lighter is wonderful.,1
We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great!,1
This is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent. It is a great little tablet.,1
Easy for my kid to use and navigate through. Fun for adults too.,1
2 way radio drained batteries daily so too expensive,-1
Exactly what I needed.,1
Very easy for a small child to use. very kid friendly,1
These batteries are just as good as any name brand,1
I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.,1
cheap but good,1
The tablet is the perfect size to fit into my purse for taking everywhere.,1
Easy to use and great parental controls to limit or access content.,1
Outstanding,1
Pretty good basic battery.,1
just what I needed. thank you,1
Very good batteries! The price point is great and free shipping. Who really could ask for more!,1
Good price.,1
good pricing,1
Love the amazon batteries. Great price and they last long!,1
I wanted something for games and reading so I thought this was a great deal. I have enjoyed it so much. Passes a lot of time for me. Easy to download on too.,1
You can't beat these batteries when it comes to price. My son has seemingly a million toys that require batteries and it's always handy to have some around when he leaves them on (thomas the train motorized engines). Buying these from Amazon saves me a lot of money vice buying them from a major retailer. Thanks Amazon!Pro: cheap and reliable,1
decent quality battery strength for price. better than dollar store for sure,1
Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.,1
"This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value.",1
Nice device I like to use it to read books online.,1
Great deal and they work fine! Very pleased with these. Comparable to major brands.,1
"Wow, I love my Amazon Fire HD 16 GB in black. It is just the right size, and works perfectly. Loved it so much, I ordered 2 more for my grandchildren, in Marine Blue and Punch Red. I am totally satisfied!",1
Love these batteries and price was fantastic for the quality!,1
bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it,1
I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.,1
"Extra features are nice and upgrading from the Kindle Paperwhite was fairly simple. Amazon did an automatic system update which was not cool. There should have been an option to update when we wanted, not when they wanted.",1
i bought 2 for a 3 and 4 year old grand-babies and its so easy to use for both of us.,1
I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.,1
My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased.,1
"good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this.",1
"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text.",1
"Good batteries, good price. No issues.",1
"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful",0
Works as expected from a battery. Would buy again.,1
Good deal for batteries that we seem to use a lot!,1
It is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use,1
"Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader.",1
"When I opened the package there were only 17 batteries, not the 20 that I ordered and paid dor.",-1
Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.,1
Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free,1
This is a great learning tool for our 3 year old she loves it!,1
As good as any others,1
"I got this little tablet to carry around with me because it fits in my purse. I like it for what I got it to do - have something to read all the time, but it's REALLY slow. So if you're impatient and don't want to wait for apps to load, don't get this!",1
Excellent batteries.,1
Good buy,1
"I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection.",1
sdfgsdfgsdfgsdfgsdfg,1
I literally can't think of anything else you would say about batteries,1
I bought four of these for my kids and they love them,1
I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.,1
"When I opened the pack and put them in a device, it already said battery low.",0
"With an Income Tax Preparation practice I'm on my laptop 10 hours a day entering data. Using the laptop keyboard and mouse pad on the flat and level angle that laptops offer is stressful. An elevated keyboard serves the purpose of 'tilting' the keyboard into a natural position for typing. This AmazonBasic Ventilated and Adjustable laptop stand is perfect and produces the effect of a typewriter slant for those who grew up on IBM Selectrics or Royals. Fully adjustable for just about any angle you are comfortable with. Well made, light weight and it looks as a 'piece of the laptop' in sight. One small warning: the tabs on the front end that keep your laptop from sliding off may be a bit short for some laptops. The tabs rise only .75 of an inch (3/4). My current, and several past laptops, the front sits 1.0 inches (1) at top front but slanting down at .75 of an inch (3/4) inward. The slant keeps the tabs on the stand from holding the laptop in place - causing the laptop to slip down and off. Simple solution to this: Binder Clips. Use the medium size binder clip, one on each of the stand tabs. You can find 'binder clips' on the Amazon web site. A box is under 4 but you only need 2 medium binder clips so . . . check with a school teacher or office worker and get two for free. Other than that, the right tool at the right price. Buy one and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did.",1
"I ran my own longevity test and have the results. I have 4 identical candles, battery operated on a timer and sitting on the same table. I wondered myself which battery would last the longest. I put a EverReady battery in one, Rayovac battery, one AmazonBasics battery and one Maxell battery purchased from amazon.com. They were all purchased within a week of each other (thanks for friends and family that each donated two battery). The batteries were put in each candles at the same time and set the timer to 8 hours on each. After 25 days I had my first failure. The Rayovac candle didn't turn on. At day 26 the Maxell battery failed. and at day 27 the EverReady failed to turn on my candle. Along came day 27 - five hours into the 8 hour set timer and the AmazonBasics didn't make my candle work. I know this isn't a 'scientific' test but satisfied me as to which battery I will be buying from now on and those friends and family will now also be buying AmazonBasic Performance Alkaline Batteries.",1
So many kid friendly apps for my 1 year old! She loves this thing!,1
"Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy.",-1
"I bought this for my mom while she was in rehab following shoulder surgery. She loved it. I put several books on it for her and she liked the ease of use, she does not get on the computer and so I needed it to be easy.",1
"Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!!",1
"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons.",1
Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students.,1
This is awesome! I have a 4 year old grandson and he loves the tablet!!It's kid friendly and has great games that he likes!!Would recommend it!!My 9 year grandson also traded in his drawing pad for a tablet and he loves it!!,1
I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .,0
"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine",1
they work. I don't know the life span or how well they work.,1
"The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7.",1
"Great batteries, exactly what we needed. Thanks for the bulk pack, it was perfect.",1
If I need an add on item to ship I always buy Amazon batteries. They work great,1
"Great deal, better than local stores",1
"Very nice packaging! Love the price and the nice convenient packaging makes it easy to store, find and keep track of the batteries. Great job Amazon!",1
Terrible life. These are poorest quality batteries I have ever purchased both AA and AAA,1
These batteries work great. No problems with any of them so far. Would definitely buy again. I think they're about the same price as the costco brand ones.,1
Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read,1
Awesome value for the price tons of apps and good screen quality,1
"Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can't go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for "" older eyes"".",1
"I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain.",1
Great for my kids. Syncs to all of our Amazon videos and netflix. The protective kids case is a must. Makes it easier for smaller kids to hold without touching the screen. Also does well with drops to the ground,1
My son loves it he's only 3 understands how to use it and I can see it has helped him learn word animals and etc.. it's a very good way to keep the brain moving and active.,1
Favorite brand in my household. Great price and long lasting.,1
Ok,1
Shipped fast and so far lasting like other major brand batteries.,1
I bought two of these for my 82 year old mother and 88 year old aunt - they love them! Easy to use! Great gift. Can't wait to buy one for me!,1
It is perfect for kids. My youngest son can use it,1
"Not very user friendly, in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough. However a great tablet for a child to play with.",1
"I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands.",1
got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.,1
Great cheap batteries! Lasts as long as Duracell,1
This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful.,1
Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.,1
It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.,0
"Great tablet, not for the power user. Average users will find everything they need.",1
"Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps.",1
I bought it for my grandson‚Äôs birthday... he loves it;),1
"Cant beat it.. performs just as good if not better than the big brands, at more than half the cost.. Life span is awesome thus far.. ill never buy from the big guys again.",1
"This tablet is great for browsing the internet, very affordable",1
These things really supply power!,1
Shortest battery life ever... definitely don't try to save a few bucks here ...,-1
Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.,-1
"My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on.",1
After reading the reviews and also seeing in the description that this has a 2 year unconditional warranty we were sold. Our child loves this tablet and he's dropped it many times with no damage. The thick padded case really does work wonders for this.,1
Great value,1
"My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don't have any complaints about it.",1
I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!,1
"Purchased for my grandson for Christmas. Comes charged and ready to setup. Setup process is relatively painless, though it does require an Amazon account and payment source. The display is bright and sharp and response snappy. Available memory from the indicated 16 GB is around 10 GB after stock apps and operating system space allotted. For daily use that should be sufficient but downloaded content (not necessarily application) can be stored on a micro SD card (not included). All in all I'm very pleased with this purchase. Should my opinion change after Christmas, I'll let you know. ;)",1
"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long.",0
Bought this tablet to read books and it also has other good qualities.,1
Great value for the money,1
"I added to a ""dot"" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!",1
is very good product and the difiitioin is very good thanks,1
I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.,1
"I love how affordable these batteries are! The fact that they arrive quickly, are good quality, neatly packaged...there is nothing negative to say!",1
This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing.,1
"I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers.",1
These batteries really last.,1
Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down.,1
Awesome upgrade to the kindle line. 16gb with optional card slot. Amazing price and free shipping.,1
Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs,1
"The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price.",1
its okay,0
I'm glad I purchased this item. I bought for my niece and she loves it,1
I definitely feel that I got my money's worth with this purchase!,1
This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen,1
"This is a great tablet for my 3 year old grandson. The cover is great in that, if he drops it, it won't break! Great buy",1
"This is a great tablet , lots of fun for the kids I reccomend big time.",1
Nice value for these batteries... they all work well and last and the price is perfect! We always have to stock up on batteries for Xmas gifts so this was a great way to do that.,1
light and compact and a little slow with the apps and images,1
Easy to set up and turn on and off restrictions. Piece of mind that daughter can't access adult appropriate content,1
"A high quality product, right up there with any of the main name brand batteries. These batteries are long lasting, and reliable. Though the order is a bulk one, these are shrink wrapped into packs of 4, which is super convenient for grab and go situations. I would recommend this product, and I will buy again!",1
Great price works great I have no complaints about the product I would recommend to any one that loves kindle,1
Good price,1
no problems,1
This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update,-1
"Excellent, thank you",1
"My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made .",1
Work well.,1
Great value and quality batteries. I have 4 kids and typically go through batteries pretty regularly from all the video game controllers. I found these ones to last just as well as the other name brands for a lot less money. Highly Recommend.,1
"For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc",1
great buy. why spend more for duracell when these do the job,1
"Easy to set up and durable design. Free time is a great feature, taking parental control to the next level. The screen resolution and camera are amazing.",1
Got the tablet for my mom for christmas! She absolutely loves it!!,1
"Can't live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer.",1
Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted.,1
"They work really well, and the value is excellent for the price.",1
This is a great learning tool for our 3 year old she loves it!,1
They're the only batteries I use now. It's hard to beat the /battery cost. Every parent should have a stash of these and the Amazon AA's in their home.,1
What a great value. Lasts as long as any other brand name maybe even longer! I will buy again,1
Good so far.,1
Works perfectly for a phone with a loopy case. Good placement options for using maps.,1
"I am pleasantly surprised with the Amazon Basics batteries. They seem to stack up with the name brand batteries just fine. Dollar for dollar, that makes Amazon Basics a winner! The best surprise of all is the absolute genius way of packaging the batteries. The box is perfect! I no longer need to dedicate a container because of the cardboard box that they are shipped in works great!",1
Great quality and great price :),1
These batteries are a real steal when compared to store bought. Much more value when compared to free shipping from Amazon. Would order them again in a heart beat.,1
Got tablet for my daughter..love everything about it and how easy it is to use.,1
This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup.,1
"Is nice for reading, sometimes the screen is a little slow. Hate the ads on the main screen",1
The ads that pop up constantly make us almost unusable for kids.,-1
great buy,1
Brought wrong size for the walkie talkies i purchased..but can find use for them,0
Great.,1
Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
excellent,1
This is a great tablet. There are thousands of books and movies and music to choose from the Amazon store. It is very easy to navigate,1
Good price on multi pack of Alkaline Batteries.,1
great batteries! Will never buy another brand again!,1
These we got for the flashlight for a birthday party. They work.,1
"I bought for wife and she loves it. Not as good as Ipad but for the price one could not get better. Battery lasts and no game crashes. Prime is a plus for all the perks. No need to install Google Play, Prime store rocks.",1
"While it seemed to work fine, the Tap does not have the open mic feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens. The Tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with Alexa, which seems to defeat the purpose.",-1
My special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at $200.00 each. The Amazon Fire Kids Edition is such a better option. It is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. I can even use it in adult mode. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly highly recommend it.,1
I buy this tablet for my nephew and he is happy with it.,1
I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.,1
THE AMAZONBASICS ALKALINE BATTERIES WORK VERY WELL WITH MY DIGITAL CAMERA.,1
I have not stopped reading on this amazon fire. Love it!!,1
Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.,1
After 2nd recharge and use all but 3 are leaking corrosive fluid which has ruined my charger.,-1
as expected,1
Great product,1
"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug.",1
He is an Apple lover but the fact that you can download things for when you aren‚Äôt connected to WiFi is the big winner! He‚Äôs grown to love it !,1
"Excellent long lasting batteries ,put all the expensive stuff to shame, SHIPPED IN AWESOME LITTLE AMAZON BOX .......",1
"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization.",1
Lasts as long as big brand names versions!,1
I can not put it down. I am reading all the time with kindle unlimited. Or multi tasking with all the options. There is not much that you can not do with this.,1
Great,1
"The bag fits a 17.3 laptop quite snuggly, but it fits nonetheless. There is a considerable amount of space in each of the available sections, along several accessory pockets for those smaller items. The 2 mesh side pockets are big enough for a standard plastic water bottle, but not big enough for a nalgene water bottle.Taking it on a couple destinations so if there are any issues I find with it, I will edit my comments accordingly. As it stands now, good solid bag for the price and it does fit larger laptops.",1
"Great tablet for the purpose of reading, also inexpensive",1
"Bought this for my 5 year old girl. She immediately fell in love with it. And the fact that it has a year damage warranty, it was a no brainer",1
Great product. The price is great as well!,1
overall its ok just make sure you have a memory card if you have a lot of apps,1
I got this tablet for Skype calls and browsing. It's good if you don't have an ample scope of tasks,1
My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased.,1
as advertised,1
Excellent value.,1
"Dammit, I ordered these by accident. Was supposed to order AA's, FML.",1
it's a great tablet for the money. I would buy another.,1
This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up.,1
"No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem",1
As above a high class e reader. Love it. Use it at least 2-3 hrs daily.,1
Will never buy batteries anywhere else!,1
"Got this for my son, he loves it and is easy to use and add stuff for kids, the warranty is an added bonus. Plus pretty durable, since having a 2 year old, when he throws fits, this gets thrown as well.",1
"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer.",-1
"Seem to work just fine. Just as good as the big name brand batteries from what I can tell, maybe a bit better.I like the packaging.",1
I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.,1
Fresh batteries with excellent shelf life and in use duration -- superb price,1
Great product price,1
"For the price Amazon is offering these tablets they're great! Honestly, if you're looking for something to watch Netflix, YouTube, basic apps as well as play a few games these tablets are amazing. I love the fact that their great quality for the price. Obviously they're not the best tablets in the entire world, but for what you pay, their fantastic.",1
WORKING GREAT,1
Work well,1
I need the Geek Squad to help me with the Amazon Prime I purchased it for 2 granddaughters but I don't want them to have access to my books.,1
Easy to use. Quick setup. Fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant.,1
Got this for my Grandson's birthday. He really wanted a tablet and I wanted something that wasn't so breakable. He was so excited and he loves it,1
Tablet is easy to use for everyone The camera is good. Love the protector for the occasional drops. Can't beat the 2 year no questions asked replacement from the manufacturer.,1
Great deal for batteries. I don't notice they perform any differently than other batteries.,1
My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!,1
pretty fast and reliable the video quality is great,1
"My kid love this tablet!! The setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! That my kid can enjoy playing and learning!!",1
"They work, its a battery at a cheap price.",1
Do not leave these batteries sitting on a dresser... or pretty much anywhere you don't want battery acid leaked onto. We took the batteries out of our remote at night and woke up to our brand new 3500 dresser ruined. Awesome.,-1
Good quality and value,1
Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.,1
"So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc.",1
last a long time and cheap Got me hooked,1
This a great item for kids to learn how to use electronics.,1
Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great.,0
These batteries are priced very well and also work great! I'm glad I bought them and I highly recommend them.,1
"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.",1
Great price. Delivered on time.,1
Great price for the quantity but it seems they don't last as long as the major brands.,0
Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.,1
It is the first time I purchased Amazon Basic AA Alkaline batteries and I am glad I did. It is a solid performer at reasonable price.. Will buy more in the future for sure!,1
good,1
"Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort.",1
Good product at good price.,1
"These are okay. They aren't as long-lasting as name brands so in the end, I'm probably not saving money using these. That said, I like how they are packaged so they take up little space and we only have to open a 4 pack each time while still having plenty on hand. This beats the big packages of the name brands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer.",0
Nice size and color. It was easy to grip. very pleased,1
I liked it a lot for my four year old and it is kids proof,1
Got it for my grandson he loves it.it is a very good tablet!!!,1
"I didn't have high expectations for these batteries - inexpensive as they were. But they've managed to last at least as long as the name brand we've purchased in the past! With a 4 year old and several battery operated toys, we seemingly traded our consumption of diapers for batteries - we need to buy them by the case. Trying to keep the toys off when not in use and 'save' the batteries is a concept my 4 year old does NOT grasp. So while he's having a great time with a toy in the evening, by morning it was dead. So fresh batteries to the rescue. AmazonBasics batteries are not only cost effective, but they have a life span at least equal to previous name brand batteries we've bought.We will be buying more of these (probably a LOT more!)",1
Limited use if you dont want to enroll with amazon,1
great batteries,1
: ),1
"so far, so good",1
"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old.",1
"This is definitely an improvement over the paperwhite, not sure is worth the premium though. While faster than paperwhite it is still way less responsive than an iPad, it is very hard to type on it (when searching or sharing on goodreads for instance).I like the navigation areas on the edge of the screen but I'm not crazy about them. I'm not sure what would be a better alternative but they are not all that comfortable while reading in bed. I guess a thumb swipe would still be better if the device would respond more nicely.I previously had a Paperwhite which got lost and I thought I'd better buy the latest kindle now.When I bought the paperwhite it has been an experiment, as I'm not an avid reader and I have a hard time reading paper book since I got surrounded by gadgets. I actually read few books on the paperwhite and I enjoyed it. So when I lost it (misplaced it) I was longing for it as I had few books I wanted to read.If this would be priced at least $50 cheaper I think it would be a 5 star proposition. Like it is now, it is a tad too expensive for the scope and the shortcomings. Closer to $100 it would be a sweet price.Prefered buying at BestBuy over Amazon as the loyalty programs are better (vs nonexistent) and I also used a movers coupon.",1
"I bought two of these for my kids, and they love them. They are responsive, durable, and inexpensive. Of course, whether it works for you depends on your usage scenario. If you are looking for a full-featured tablet computer to use for content creation, serious research, or other work-related tasks, you should look at an iPad Pro. But if you are looking for a device for games, entertainment, casual reading, and consuming Amazon content, this device works great. If you're looking for something for your kids and don't want to shell out $350 or more for an iPad, I'd strongly recommend checking this Kindle Fire out. We replaced two cracked screen iPads, and my kids haven't missed a beat with these.",1
The Kindle Fire is small but does everything it should for a young child. Worth the low cost I paid for it.,1
"Excellent product, powerful batteries!",1
"I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7"" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8"" and is much faster.",1
I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you.,1
Great price and last a long time.,1
Great to have as a backup,1
is very good product and the difiitioin is very good thanks,1
This is a great tablet for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure it all out. I would recommend going ahead and purchasing a sd card bc the storage space ran out very quickly.,1
good price work fine,1
Bought this for my 5 year old and he loves it. Fairly easy for him to use and me to monitor. Definitely recommend the case.,1
My only problem with this tablet is if you don't have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them.,1
Great product for good price,1
They seem just as good as any I have bought from the store. I have used them for countless things and have had no problems. They came on time and it is great to have the convenience of delivery.,1
"I don't know, I bought them for someone else.",1
"If you‚Äôre on a budget or media consumption is your only use, then this is the best you can get. The Amazon bloat can slow down the device, not to mention the restrictions imposed but at this price, you get what you pay for",1
So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.,1
"Thrilled with the ease of use, so easy to navigate! I wish I had started with a tablet like this, it would have saved me a lot of frustration.",1
"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though",0
"They are batteries, they work and they last...What else",1
batteries didnt even last one month...very dissapointed,-1
"My daughter has been wanting one for quite sometime! I love the durability, and that I can set limits to what she does!!",1
Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again,1
The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.,1
"If you own an Alexa Device, This is a must have. It makes using an Amazon Device so easy. The OS is Android. It is not the most user friendly device for getting out apps but you will figure it out sooner or later. I deducted a star for that. For the price, It is a good device. Thanks!",1
"Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far.",1
Lots of energy !!,1
Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.,1
I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.,1
The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.,1
"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere.",1
Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed?,1
Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.,1
Worked great!,1
"I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging.",-1
"Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase.",1
Awesome batteries and Awesome price!,1
Work Fine.,1
They lasted really little.. (some of them) I use all batteries for same led lamps and 2 out of 4 Drained the Battery Quickly.,-1
"No complaints, seem to work as well as other brands",1
Excellent tablet! I purchased for someone in a nursing home and she loves it!,1
Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it!,1
"With alot of kids and toys in the house we have been running through hundreds of batteries. Yes hundreds, no typo. I have found these batteries to have the perfect balance of cost vs longevity. They dont last the longest but theyre priced just right to make it worth it. I would recommend to anyone that needs batteries in bulk.",1
Hold's a charge nice. I will buy these again.,1
It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids,1
My 4 Year old grandson likes to play games and watch movies. This was the best ever purchase I've done.,1
"With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD.",1
It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.,1
Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.,-1
Great value,1
Great price works great I have no complaints about the product I would recommend to any one that loves kindle,1
"This is my second Kindle Fire and I have been extremely pleased with them both. This second one is much more versatile, and I love it!",1
"Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights.",1
Great - easy to use. Nice and clear screen. Would recommend,1
"I love the Amazon fire. It is very user friendly. It's great for reading books, streaming music, and watching movies.",1
It use for a long time .,1
I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.,1
Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.,-1
good,1
Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.,1
"Amazon Echo is great. But it is stuck at home. Amazon Tap on the other hand goes everywhere. In the short time we have had ours, we have brought it to Sweden, Portugal, the lake up north and friend's houses. It has served as a music host at card games, answered questions and added things to our shopping list. It is easy to set up Amazon Tap to a wifi network using the Alexa app on your smartphone. You can also easily pair several devices to the Tap via Bluetooth. What really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated. New skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis. Amazon really hit home with the Tap as the voice interface is so easy to use, and the portability makes it a great.",1
"Bought as a gift for my Mom. She's so happy. Therefore, I'm happy",1
"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again.",-1
"Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend.",1
These seem to last just as long as the name brand ones. Will buy again.,1
Great battery at a great price,1
"Excellent, exactly as described",1
"My kids watch movies in the car, I link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. I have set up hulu / netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. Amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. And worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!!!!!",1
The price is unbeatable! Never buying batteries at CVS agaun,1
All Excellent!!!,1
"Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination",0
"I've stopped buying regular batteries (AA, AAA, etc...) anywhere but Amazon.For the price, these are unbeatable for standard alkaline batteries.Especially with toddler toys....batteries come and go, fast.",1
Amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great,1
good batteries they have amazons name on them,1
Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.,1
good value for the money ..............................................................................................................,1
This tablet is perfect for travel! Recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on Netflix. Great first tablet!,1
They work great!,1
"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful.",1
"Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.",1
Works just as good as other batteries that I have bought. Even in high drain electronics! Great value for this price!,1
Good,1
well worth it,1
Great batteries and a lot cheaper than the name brands. Would definitely recommend!,1
"Went cheap...got cheap. DO NOT BUY. Went to pack for an upcoming trip and noticed brown stuff all over. I was storing the batteries in a separate case (which is now ruined). Thank goodness this wasn't in any if my expensive scuba or camera equipment. Never had other brands do this. Always store batteries outside of equipment anyways. Totally bummed. Shame on you Amazon. Get out of the battery business. I buy A LOT on Amazon... ALOT, but no more batteries.",-1
I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals,1
The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.,1
good batteries good price,1
Never disappointed.,1
Seem to have a great life to them. I'm impressed.,1
I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded,1
This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted.,1
overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice,1
Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it's for the little ones just to keep it protected.,1
I was looking for a Good tablet under $100..this delivered..getting used to Amazon apps LOL,1
Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.,1
Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase.,1
Great bang for your buck. Great for taking to meetings.,1
"The batteries seem to do just as well as any other batteries I might get from the store. I appreciate the effiency of just being able to order them from Amazon, and I like that I can get such a large quantity at a good price.",1
Good product!,1
These seem to work well. Haven't used them for too long but they were a good price.,1
"Hey, they work and priced great. Nice to have plenty on hand for the million things that take double A. Nicely packaged in box, but then the plastic wrap around them is a bit much.",1
Sent me old dead batteries,-1
The RIGHT item delivered FAST at a GOOD price. What more can you ask for They are AAA batteries work as expected.,1
I really like the bigger screen. These are great for traveling with children,1
Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price.,1
It is a perfect gift for kids and great warranty...,1
Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use.,1
"Nice box, good price. Only improvement would be to eliminate the 4pack wrapping. The clear plastic wrap seems like an unnecessary step when changing our kids toy batteries",1
"Long lasting battery, great price! What more could I ask for",1
My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.,1
"Amazon started this wonderful company way back when. Can you remember when there was NO Amazon, neither can I. The company became so successful at selling someone else's products, Amazon decided to start selling their own, thus Amazon Basics was born. Amazon Basic encompasses so many products, that are sold at such a reasonable price with excellent quality,that you should always look for Amazon Basics first.Recently, my Amazon Echo's remote, stopped working. I use the remote so much as a Bluetooth, information giver etc etc etc, and guessed correctly that the AAA battery had run it's last mile. I had one battery left, inserted it and off we went. I realized I need to obtain a new supply of batteries, and entity Amazon's website. I found the Amazon Basics batteries,meets price and in a quantity of eight. I am now prepared for the holiday onslaught of battery needs. Just insert into your product and off you go.Recommended. prisrob 10-20-15",1
Double AA batteries for about for about a quarter apiece. Very solid deal. Five stars.,1
"let's face it batteries can be stupid expensive. I usually buy top name brand batteries but, after reading some reviews I decided to try amazons brand. I will say I think they are just as good as any top brand battery. I am very happy with the quality and life span of the amazons brand battery and will continue to buy them. Thanks.",1
Great working batteries! Best prices from anywhere I have found. Love how they're packaged in groups of 4!,1
My son loves this and the parental controls are easy to use!,1
"good price, worked fine",1
great for the kids and protection is good ! and best buy is making me write more stuff here so that people can go ahead and buy this product...,1
"We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range.",1
"My husband is bed bound and sometimes very weak. The kindle is great for him ,light easy to use and the back light allows him to read in bed without waking me to turn the lights on.",1
doesn't work with everything. baby toys good. electronics not so much,0
"In my opinion, works just as well as all the top name brand ones. I didn't perform any fancy tests, but I will buy them again.",1
Batteries were inexpensive and long-lasting.,1
"Solid state of the art tablet, kids enjoyed a lot and easy to work with",1
They work well so far no complaints. They are great little batteries and would buy again.,1
"I'll admit I was a bit worried when buying these because of the price, but they have held up and last a longtime. I highly recommend over the overpriced big brand batteries.",1

"My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink.",1
Excellent Batteries,1
"Delivered quickly! We love it. Easy to use, long battery life.",1
Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.,1
"I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong.",1
"As other reviewer commented, thank you, these batteries expiration date was 5+ years off when we purchased them. We've not had any problems with any of them. Many applications just do not do well with those rechargeable batteries, so these fit the bill nicely.",1
"I buy these in bulk for kids toys and for the 20 LED flashlights i have scattered around my house and car. Good value, and I like that they are available in large quantities.",1
Drains way too quickly,-1
Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!,1
They work real good and were the right price.,1
"Good Price, excellent packaging, and the batteries last a long time in comparison with other brand batteries I have tried that only came with four in the pack for the same price! Will order these from now on from Amazon!!",1
Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not.,1
"Loving my kindle! Can read all the books I want from the library without leaving the house! And when it‚Äôs time to move, no more heavy boxes to haul!",1
Bought for my wife to read ebooks. She has done that and in addition is playing games on it.Very pleased.,1
I purchased the pack to use with 4 walkies i had when we went on a 4 day cruise. Each walkie took 3 batteries. The batteries lasted 2.5 days of use. And i had to replace.,1
Very Good...,1
These batteries seem to be just as good as brand name batteries,1
Way to go amazon! These Batteries are great!,1
These are available at a good price and come in handy for rounding out orders to make free shipping minimums. So far they seem to last as long as the name brand products.,1
I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!,1
It a great tablet for children. But it doesnt work with google apps.,1
They're batteries and they work. The real test is for how long LOL! I'll have to get back to ya on that down the road!,1
I got this because it is almost impossible to break,1
Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up,1
"These are great batteries, at a great deal. They last a long time and we are very happy with the purchase. We did however have some that are DOA, I called Amazon and they took care of us, AWESOME customer service, as always.",1
I bought this for my daughter. I like it all in all. I was unaware that it didn't have a google to do internet searching.,1
I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.,1
"5 stars for value, would recommend to a friend.",1
For two girls that love to play games and take with them,1
"I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader.",1
I absolutely love this tablet. I got it for my 3 year old for Christmas so she wouldn't steal mine all the time. Great for kids i downloaded Netflix and I could download lots of movies and shows so she could watch in the car without having Wifi. Would recommend it to anyone with kids,1
Some batteries didn't work,-1
Device size and speed are more than adequate for an 8 year old. I love Freetime and the ability to set limits for weekdays and weekends so my grandson is able to play without my direct supervision. Apps and books are age appropriate. I may have to buy 2 more for the 4 year olds.,1
GREAT BATTERIES,1
I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!,1
"It's a fast tablet, but doesn't get all the games you can get at the play store. Many apps not available for Kindle.",0
This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.,1
"Nothing really special, but they work just fine and aren't too expensive.",1
I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!,1
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.,0
"Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price.",1
"Grandchild is exploring and learning so much, having fun",1
My Grandson loves his tablet we got him. Very safe,1
"Why people buy batteries at the store any more is beyond me. The price on these can't be beat and they last as long as the name brand batteries. Even better they show up at your door, leaving you do spend time doing things you want to do.",1
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it‚Äôs great for entertainment.",1
"Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale.",1
"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!",1
As described,1
Great cheap batteries. No more over paying for them!,1
Best bang for your buck. All the batteries last as long as leading brands for a fraction of the cost. We've got 3 kids and we go through batteries like crazy over here. I cannot even begin to tell you how much money these Amazon batteries have saved us! Thanks!,1
"I was impressed with the overall of this Kindle, it has so many nice features and easy access.",1
My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!,1
This was for my sister birthday. She really like it a lot.,1
Great batteries at a good price very convenient to get.,1
"So far so good. Great value. Well packaged, nice clean design and arrived quickly.",1
Good batteries that hold charge and great price!,1
I bought it for my fianc√© and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.,1
Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price.,1
"Love it. So easy to use. I previously had a Nook Color, but since the newest Nook was having problems getting library books at the time I decided to go with Kindle. Worried I would lose the Nook books I had purchased over the years. Nope not a problem. Just had to download a couple of apps. m.getjar.com to download 3rd party apps. Once that is downloaded, open m.getjar and find Nook there. Easy peasy.",1
Good inexpensive tablet for my daughter. I picked up on Black Friday for 50 bucks. She loves it.,1
No problems with AmazonBasic Batteries.,1
Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.,1
"This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing.",1
"This may seem silly, but probably the main reason I love these is that they come in a compact cardboard box that easily opens and closes. Sick of having batteries roll around in a drawer, I was trying to find a container. None seemed to be all that good. But, with these, you don't need it! Such a brilliant concept! I get so many things in cardboard boxes that I throw out. But batteries Whoever thought of this deserves a pay raise.",1
"These have worked really well. I've had these batteries for a few months, and I don't think any of the items that I have used that required batteries have died yet. Hoping the batteries continue to work for awhile longer. It is really nice have a large supply of batteries especially since these last so long!",1
"WTH!! Went through these extremely fast - it seems there were many DUDS filtered in with a few good batteries!! by the time I realized this, it was over thirty days, so live and learn.",-1
I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.,1
This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.,1
"my son loves it, is on it all the time, loves all the games. always trying to download all things all the time.",1
seem to be of good quality,1
This is the reading machine I will recommended for everyone. The sharp font and responsiveness is unparalleled,1
Great batteries. I haven't noticed a difference between these and other top name brand batteries. And these are way cheaper!,1
Gifted with Xmas toys.,1
Batteries seem like any other they work and seem to last,0
"Work great, like the packaging and good value",1
I was looking to purchase a tablet for my kids so they could work on homework. This is just what they need in terms of capability and size. It is a great tablet for the price.,1
No frills but just what I needed.,1
Be Careful with this one - I put 4 of these into my TV remote and almost immediately had one pop. I could hear a sizzling sound within the remote and I immediately took out the battery carrier (I inserted them in proper polarity). One of the batteries was actually fizzling at the female end where it had split and was leaking. Unreal.... I've never had a battery do this before. I will NOT be ordering these ever again.,-1
48 batteries for twelve bucks Where are you going to beat that price!! That's only 25 cents per battery!!!,1
This tablet is cheap but wonderful. I bought 3 on black friday just to give them to family members.,1
"We use them on a battery operated fan on high. Fan says on high will run for about 11 hours before needing new batteries. These last for two nights, after first night it is running down but still keeps going. Pretty cool",1
"This is the perfect tablet for a toddler. I feel like there is stuff for him to now, but he can also grow with it. And it's built like a tank.",1
"My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink.",1

"Seem to work just fine. For the price, it's a good deal.",1
Not bad i guess,0
"I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps.",1
Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise!,1

"AMAZING DEAL!!!So many batteries for an amazing price!!! In the stores, you get half the amount of batteries for double the price.100 will re buy.work great. FAST SHIPPING TO! (ONLY TOOK A DAY)",1
"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it.",1
Very dissappintes with these. Have had to replace almost all of them.,-1
"this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range",1

Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this,1
"As good as the brand name batteries at considerably less cost. I have tried numerous off brand batteries in the past. None of them have ever lasted as long as the name brands, and some were almost dead right out of the box. I have found these batteries to last just as well as the name brand batteries, in both the AA and AAA sizes. I have not tried the D or C cells yet.",1
Great product. As advertised. Very easy to set up profiles with daily goals and limits. Great purchase.,1
My children love the tablet. It's a good price and the apps that come with it are great.,1
Good,1
Help my 2 year learn he loves to play it and watch movies on it,1
"Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price.",1
I bought this as an exchange Gift for Christmas!!! My Mom fought over it and eventually won it! She Loves It!!!,1
"The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started.",1
OK,1
Good battery for money,1
"I was initially happy that my Kindle replacement charging cord arrived so promptly, it seemed to work fine. But after only one use, the outer covering of the cord started cracking falling off in bits. It now is almost completely covered by electrical tape, as the bits fall off w/ each every use. I will end up having to buy a new one after all...",-1
Adequate,-1
Will have to see the life of battery is,1
"Saw this deal and could not pass up. I have a pair of headphones that use AAA batteries, they lost longer than expected i doubt i will ever run out.",1
Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.,1
I got this for my son for his 4th birthday and he loves it. The kids section is the best.,1
great batteries,1
This is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free. It keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning.,1
"Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa",1
A great price for a large amount of batteries. These last just as long as name brand batteries if not longer!,1
Being a gamer I go through batteries quite frequently. I do have rechargeable battery packs but I often forget to plug them in and I am too impatient to wait to play until after they are charged. These batteries have surprised me with how long they last in my XBox 360 Controllers!,1
I bought two of these for two of my children. The parental controls are great and I can easily control their access to content. The ability to make them do something educational like read for 30 min before playing games is awesome. This tablet does everything I wanted it to do.,1
Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.,1
"Some of the best batteries I've ever bought. Last a long time, and VERY nicely packages. Batteries are individually packaged into packs of 4 so that is very nice.",1
"Enjoyed the color, construction, and ability to control viewing for our daughter.",1
I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.,1
Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus.,1
"Yep, they work! And it is nice to know I have backups.",1
I'm happy with the product and the price! Amazon basics is my new battery company!,1
Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.,1
Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.,1
"First of all- buying batteries is never fun . It's also quite expensive. I fell in love with the fact , I could buy these Amazon branded batteries through prime and get them in two days .But guess what. I got them in 1 day!!! Plus , I stocked up for all those dang Christmas toys for my triplets. If I buy one, I have to buy three!!!!They lasted just as long as a standard battery . Plus , I love that they come in a nice cardboard sleeve. Rather than the ones at the store where they all fall out when you rip the plastic from the cardboard.To wrap up- these were very impressive.",1
Great price and very long lasting. I haven't noticed any difference between the amazon basics and Duracell batteries,1
"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working.",0
Perfect for my granddaughter for her Christmas present,1
"I wanted to buy a Tap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Alexa enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphones.Sound quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. This is currently the most flexible implementation of Alexa and I recommend it.",1
Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints,1
"I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the ""free shipping"" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo!",1
My son loves his own kindle! Very kid friendly and easy for him to use. It is great that he now has his own!,1
My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better.,1
granddaughter loves it and easy and durable. loves the pink case.,1
I like that this tablet can grow with my 5 year old. I love the various age settings and the parental controls. Perfect first tablet!,1
I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.,-1
Great screen clarity and rapid turn on.All function you need in a transportable tablet,1
good price and good stuff,1
This is a great tablet for a kid! It is easy to use and play on!,1
Purchased for my daughter. She loves it. $129.99 and even got a price adjustment once it went it sale.,1
"I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10"" tablets before, and this one is just the right size.",1
"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!",1
My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone,1
"Great batteries, works perfectly fine.",1
"These work just as good, if not better than any other battery.",1
We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.,1
"This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price.",1
"The Amazon Fire is excellent small compact, got it for my daughter's Christmas, she loves it. My daughter bought one for her grandfather which is 83 years old, he's doing good with it easy to use.",1
"Really great value for batteries. So far have tried 12 of the 48 batteries I ordered and they are all working perfectly fine just like Alkaline batteries should. The box they came in was great and I love the no frills specialty that Amazon gives with these. There's no forced marketing on you to buy more of their batteries and the packaging was great. The price was fantastic for the 48 pack which would normally cost at least 5 - 10 more at a retail store for 24 batteries.Like I said, performance-wise these are great. I may order some of the rechargeable batteries in the future.",1
This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!!,1
Great deal. Batteries are perfect!,1
I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap.,1
"This tablet is one of the best.You won't regret buying this one.Good work,Amazon.",1
"This is a great entry tablet, if you do not want to dish out a few hundred dollars you should look into a fire table.",1
Works as intended. Decent battery life.,1
Great but I wouldn't use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet,1
So far everything I expected,1
Got this for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She plays on it till we have to recharge it! She loves it! Great little tablet with a host of capabilities.,1
I bought this for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He loves it!,1
Tablet very responsive. Alexa added to system adds to value,1
"The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price.",1
"Love the Dot, Hate the Tap Portable! This device will not hold a charge for even one day. The dots are amazing though.",-1
"Not universal. Did not work on garage door opener, given as gift but now cannot return.",-1
The batteries are good and I have enjoyed the use of them but why do you package 4 batterie at a time with plastic. It's a hassle to unwrap. I feel like they are prepackaged for a trip to mars,1
These may be an off brand but they work just as good and for just as long. I used these in toys and they get played with often and are still going. And I actually really liked the design of the battery it looked sleek and I loved the green color.,1
Can't say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it.,1
"My children really enjoy this tablet. We have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly, even though they were kid tablets, and I found them a little advanced for my children's ages. So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints.",1
"Do not last as long as other cut price batteries. In my Canon digital camera I cannot get off more than 3 shots before the 'low-battery' warning comes on. I am going back to Maxell, which did much better for me.I would hate to see what the capacity of the AmazonBasics EveryDay batteries are!!!",-1
"I do not find this as easy to use as my original Kindle Fire but I do like the camera a lot better, though it is not clear megapixels",0
Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.,-1
"Easy for reading, easy to hold - can send emails, takes pictures - must be connected to WIFI to get setup.",1
This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.,1
"You put these little cylinders in stuff and it makes them work -- flashlights, remotes, kitchen scales, clocks.",1
Batteries didn't last a year. Last several batteries were dead.,-1
Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.,1
Haven't Used Yet........,0
Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.,1
Good long lasting batteries. I used AA for gaming so I go through alot,1
this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon,1
They work pretty good.,1
"Awesome little batteries for flashlights, remote controls etc. They always have the greatest deals on Amazon and Amazon prime especially. I love the fact that you can get batteries at an awesome price in a hurry when store prices are ridiculous.",1
I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.,1
Great packaging!,1
Purchased it for my daughter. She love this very much. It is really good.,1
I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book,1
works well,1
We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money.,1
price is good... look good on paper.. some i have are bad.. after few times use .won't buy again unless quality goes up..,-1
Got it and it's already in use.,1
"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing.",-1
"Great price! I found no difference in the longevity of these batteries, as the more expensive brands.",1
This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.,1
AA batteries- good quality can't beat the value.,1
Great price for alot of batteries,1
Great batteries!,1
"I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that.",-1
Easy to use and set up. It is the best tablet for reading books or listening to audiobooks.,1
I bought 5 tablets for my grandchildren for Christmas. They loved them. Ages ranged from 5 to 12. Made shopping easy for this grandma.,1
Brand new and packaged inside box 4-in a row. Batteries last just as long if not more than name brand for much higher price.,1
Awesome purchase. Last a pretty long time!,1
Use for entertainment only. It works GREAT. Best option for those that don't want to spend so much for an I Pad.,1
Purchased it for in law. She loves it and has no problems with it.,1
Great product!,1
"These batteries work pretty well. They don't seem to outlast Kirkland or Duracell, but they are a good value for the .",1
User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can't complain.,1
"I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product.",0
Great batteries. Long lasting,1
"I can't say enough about the Amazon Tap. I enjoy playing music from it and that it's portable. I can play music from my Amazon prime account, Pandora or from my phone. It is fun to ask Alexa questions. Yes, Alexa cannot answer all my questions or find everything I ask for, but it is still amazing.",1
"I was buying Duracell ProCell batteries for years as the normal Duracell and Energizer batteries didn't seem to last (mostly use them in my electric shaver), but these Amazon batteries have been more impressive than the ProCell batteries. Such a bargain. I highly recommend you try the generics too.",1
they seem to work as well as any other battery I've tried.,1
Great nice to have on hand,1
Excellent,1
"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much.",1
"Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better",0
Does the job,1
awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use,1
I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.,1
Good deal for outdoor solar lights.,0
"purchased this tablet for my 2 year old and she loves it. the case is doin an amazing job with keeping the tablet good as new. the preinstalled apps are amazing and she loves them, so do I! Programs, apps, etc are all very easy for her to navigate",1
"They've been great batteries so far, since my wife uses a TI-84 and goes through duracells like no one's business. So, the subscribe and save feature saves me from getting yelled at for not having any batteries in the house, as well as she seems to be getting a bit more juice from them.Definitely recommended, especially if you're currently buying batteries from box stores.",1
So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.,1
"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.",0
"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service.",-1
"I like the Amazon line of Basics. Nothing fancy, they just work.",1
"Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned....",1
I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.,-1
Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!,1
"Works just like the big name batteries, but cheaper. Will be buying all future battery sizes from amazon.",1
These seem to be of higher quality than name brand. Definitely worth it.,1
they have to b changed alot but it good for remotes or clocks low power products,0
The tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping.,1
"Do not buy. Inconsistent quality, performance, some leak and ruin things.",-1
We bought two of these for myself and my husband. We both have loaded movies and books on them for entertainment when on the road or boat. Durable and easy to use.,1
Low cost solution that works...,1
Batteries seem to die quickly.,0
"These batteries are the worst. They leak and they die ridiculously fast. I've replaced the battery in my kitchen clock twice in the past month. They last about 6 hours of use in a Wii remote. I usually like the amazon basics brand, but these batteries were a total waste.",-1
I go through batteries a lot and found these to be very economical,1
The granddaughter loves it and she can't put it down.,1
ok,1
Good Value! Batteries do last for awhile!,1
"Easy to use, great battery life, plenty of space and amazing screen quality.",1
One of those guys on saving money sad there is no difference in alkaline batteries. I hope he knows what he's talking about.,1
Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.,1
this was a choice between the Oasis and the Voyage. i made the right choice,1
Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected,1
The few batteries I have used so far work and are holding up. Will update if they fail prematurely,1
Great value.,1
Great product. Great service!,1
"great price, I trust they will last longer than most too",1
"excellent value, seem to be excellent batteries and extra leak protection makes them even better, I will buy more",1
AOK-AS ORDERED,1
"Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase.",1
Great Batteries. I have bought them over and over. Much better than the old batteries sitting in the store.,1
works great,1
"I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid.",1
I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.,-1
Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video.,1
"For the price you can't beat this tablet for kids. I'm not a fan of Amazon's super restricted App Store, but the device itself is very good. I love the curfew feature. You can set up times that a child can or can't access the tablet without your permission.",1
"These batteries are a great buy, pretty much can't be beat for the price to quality ratio. I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure.",1
Good batts,1
Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it.,1
"This is definitely the best deal you'll find on batteries, they work really well and hold a charge comperitive to high dollar name brands",1
This was also bought as a Christmas gift works they perfect,1
My 3 year old has one and my 10 year old wanted one so now they BOTH have one. The parental controls are easy to use and work great. I would highly recommend to anyone!,1
"These work great for household items. I use them in my remote controllers and etc. These batteries are significantly cheaper than other brands and I highly recommend these for household items. That means items that require minimal power. Gaming controllers, flashlights, and toys are examples of non-household items.",1
We purchased three of these tablets for our granddaughters and they use them everyday and enjoy them. We spoke with one of the Best Buy associates and he was great telling us about this product. Made our decision easy. Thanks.,1
"Awesome, good price, great quality.",1
"Got this tablet to replace the nabi my 4 yr old daughter had. I picked this tablet because of its 2 yr no questions asked return policy, If u have kids you know they always find away to break spill or the software glitches. So far this tablet works great it's way faster then the nabi was its easy for my 4 yr old to work and I can set time limits and what she can do it also shows me what she uses and for how long each day. The tablet is light and easy for her to hold and the bumper has worked good when it has been dropped. Has a great selection of free apps books and games for a full year after that its $4.99 a month. My 8 yr old wants one now and she currently has a ipad but says the amazon works better and she loves the selection of books. I would recommend this tablet",1
Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do.,1
Quality. Convinced me to order the same for home.,1
Great product a great price point.,1
No leakage works good,1
"Because paying 20-40 dollars at Walmart (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right If you are like me and have 3 kids that all have annoying gizmos and electronic crap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer. I have not tested these with my joule thief to see how long they can last. But I'd say on par with the others.This may sound dorky-- when batteries are this cheap, you will find yourself putting them back into toys, remotes, electronics that you had previously marked as not necessary to be powered.",1
"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that.",1
great supply of batteries - especially,1
"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",1
"These have worked great in all of our flashlights, remotes, and all my kid's game controllers and toys. They last just as long if not longer than the much more expensive name brands.",1
Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.,1
Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.,1
"Good Batteries, but not as long lasting as the Duracell batteries.",1
So far these batteries have been good even on my little girl's toys. I was afraid of trying them because of the reviews they don't last long... but so far I like them and I'll be getting more when running low.,1
Tablet is great for beginners. Has a nice protective case so it doesn't break as easy. My kid likes to drop expensive things. Great buy for the price.,1
"These are fine, for the price but not as Duracell",1
I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.,1
This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It's very responsive and the screen resolution is great.,1
This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child,1
So happy with the color choices! This will be perfect for my 10 year old and I am thrilled with thr price!,1
Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!,1
"These batteries work great! No issue with battery life. I order this pack every few months to keep up with our computer mouse, video game controllers, and misc battery needs. Can't beat the price.",1
Great battery value but they don't last as long. I will order them a couple of more times to see how they work.,1
"Upgraded my kindle, easy and fast transfer from old to new",1
Great Stuff!,1
"We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too.",1
Great price and these batteries last just as long as any others,1
My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained,1
These are great! They work well. A great price too!,1
Purchased this for my wife because of the size. She loves it!,1
Great batteries.,1
"You can't go wrong with this tablet. No issues, reliable, well made.",1
This kindle does everything i want and more. No regrets on the purchase,1
I go the power,1
Long lasting cheap batteries what more do you ent,1
bought this for my 6 year old grandson who's a bit rough but loves to play games and read...he loves it,1
Happy so far. Seem to be lasting well.,1
My daughter hasn't put it down since Christmas. We're both in love! It's very easy for her to operate (she's 2) and very easy to set up. It's a win win for both parent and child.,1
"I'm enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended!",1
as good as any others,1
I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library.,1
volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.,0
Product was worth the price and more,1
Much cheaper than the bunny brand or the copper top. Does just as good of job! Highly recommended!!,1
"Bought it for my 3 year old son. Physically the product is amazing! Love the case around it, and how amazon replaces the product if anything happens, no questions asked. However, the software is terrible. I wasn't expecting much to begin with but its hard to consider this as a tablet when everything is limited. I only use it now to play movies from an external SD card, which cannot be played via kids profile",0
Battiers dont last very long,-1
The batteries work but not well or for long for anything that requires a lot of power. I bought these for flame-less candles and they are perfect for that. But when I tried to use them in a child's toy they batteries died very quickly.,0
great,1
My son loves this product. He plays video games and watch movies on his tablet. We also use it for learning. There are several learning apps you can download on this product.,1
More confusing. It would be nice to have a manual that is not online.,1
"Gave it to my grandkids (ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it.",1
This is the best deal on batteries around! They work very well! I replaced the batteries in all my kids' toys.,1
Die way too fast,-1
Can't go wrong with Amazon basics. Great bang for your buck.,1
"Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading.",1
The kindle has a wide variety of ebooks that I thouroughly enjoyed taking on my adventures.,1
Great Item and Great Price !!!,1
"Excellent value. These come packaged in little sleeves of four in a large cardboard box. Amazon Basics batteries have always been good performers. We've been using them for a couple of years and haven't had any issues with them drying up quickly or being lackluster upon first use. Nice quality, great deal.",1
This tablet has been great. Although I recommend getting a memory card so you have no storage issues!,1
these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.,-1
"As expected, good batteries, great value, not much else to say.",1
Works as they should.,1
It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.,1
Not fresh. Run down fast.,-1
got this product for my granddaughter. im #1 grandma now,1
"It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space.",1
Just what I needed,1
I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!,1
I love it!,1
Good batteries that work well,1
I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room!,1
"A nice size bulk pack of AAA batteries. Beats the prices of what walmart or target has. These are NOT rechargeable, seen some people asking if they were in the question box. Will do just fine for remotes, flash lights, kids toys etc.",1
Easy to maneuver. And great case for protection. The battery does not keep a charge long but I'm used to the iPad.,1
Great price. Packed in 4's.,1
Great as expected. My third time buying these.,1
Work really well!,1
In my greatest time of need these batteries saved the moment I have been waiting for. It was a Monday but not just any Monday. I was getting ready to watch my favorite show. But when i went to turn on my tv my remote died. All I needed was four AAA batteries I thought all was lost then. Then I heard a knock on my door alas it was the mailman and he had these magnificent batteries. I could watch my show! Five stars five stars by god these batteries deserve it!,1
great price,1
I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.,1
Great item,1
"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much.",1
I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.,1
I am so glad I got my son (5 1/2 years old) the Fire Kids Edition Tablet! It is extremely durable & provides hours of educational entertaining fun!!!,1
I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor,-1
"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card.",1
"My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it!",1
Just as described,1
Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.,1
"Nice and fresh, dated 10 years out! I use these in everything, should last a long time.",1
"Love this product.Excellent power for the money.Thank you very much,Mark S. Koslosky",1
"I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet.",0
Bought this for my mom who loves to play a variety of games. She loves it! So far the battery life is good and it provides great entertainment.,1
I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.,1
I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation.,1
"Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night.",1
affordable and useful life about the same as national brands,1
As far as performance goes they seem to be holding up well. They deliver the correct amount of power and work just fine in all the devices that require this size. Cannot beat the price on these.,1
I bought this for my granddaughter who is 2 and was able to load all the apps and books as well as her Disney movies. So far she has been unable to access anything that I don't want her to. And it has been able to withstand frequent toddler abuse.. Aka.. Throwing it. Definitely recommend.,1
great price,1
Thanks,1
"Since the details for the items are a little sparse I thought I would provide the specs listed on the power adapter.AC Input 100-240 Volts, 0.15 Amps, 50/60 HzDC Output 4.9 Volts, 0.85 AmpsThis adapter has a Flextronics part number of 09500043-200, Model A00810",1
"Great batteries, last a long time. Great price and great bang for your buck!",1
Nice amount of batteries to have for back up,1
so far no problems,1
the batteries were fine.,1
The kid really love this kindle fire. The protection for the kindle help protect the kindle,1
"They last nearly as long as name brand, but the price is amazing. Never buying other batteries again.",1
Packaged nicely in four packs and within a sturdy cardboard box. They work great!,1
Good tablet for kids in a reasonable price. Just wanted something for my ki8ds to be able to play games and watch videos on.,1
These Amazon AA batteries are great. They are just as good as any high priced battery.,1
"We buy the kindle fire for each of our grandkids as they get old enough and they love, love, love it!",1
"WORKS GOOD, NEED TO C HOW LONG THEY LAST",1
"ilovemy kindle 8"" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8"" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know.",1
Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet,1
These seem to be every bit as good as the name brands. Have used them in many applications.,1
"Great product, they work just as well as brand name batteries.",1
works as good as the big name batteries,1
Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do.,1
Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.,1
I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need,1
"I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an iPad.",1
Great would buy again,1
I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it,1
"Arrived on time and exactly as described, OK, Amazon has me hooked on some of their Basic lines of products. Great deal for what you get. Have ordered before and very pleased with the performance.",1
Not really the greatest,0
Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it,1
"23 year old with many special needs loves this tablet. I replaced her old laptop computer with this tablet which meets her needs better. She mostly uses Facebook and games, and this tablet is more portable everywhere for her.",1
"Got it for my mother-in-law. After we set it up, it wad easy for her to work. Would definitely recommend.",1
"Great price for these batteries. We are now buying all of our batteries on Amazon. At this price, batteries are roughly .25/each. Can't even get close to that price at any other store. I am not able to give you any data on whether they last longer or shorter than Everready or other commercial brands.",1
"I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it",1
"Wife loves it! Great sound, great technology! Compact and durable.",1
This thing has it all...even the cartoons that my older kids watched. Plenty of activities and teaching. 5 stars,1
"I bought 2 of these tablets for my younger cousins. One of them is a toddler and it was perfect for child friendly and educational apps. The screen is great as well, perfect for viewing downloaded and streamed content.",1
Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.,1
"We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this",1
"Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild.",1
good batteriess,1
Bought this for my grandkids and they love it. Use it for all kinds of things.,1
Great batteries. No notable difference from Duracell nor Energizer.,1
I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.,1
"These are the only batteries we ever buy, they last just as long as the national brands and the price can't be beat!",1
It's a good tablet for kids the only thing I really don't like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok,1
This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!,0
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.,1
I was pleased to see they are each marked with an approximately 10 year shelf life.,1
This is a low cost tablet. It offers many of the same features as higher priced tablets. Good buy!,1
It's great but I miss the hd option. My 5yo loves it!,1
It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast..,1
Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games,1
Buy this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it.,1
I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn't get a chance to see how camera was yet.,1
"I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!",1
This tablet was bought as a gift for my 3 year old Grandson. I researched the top selling tablets on line before deciding on this one. Best purchase EVER. This tablet will grow with him and even gets Mom and Dad's ok.,1
Exactly as described,1
"These batteries are seeming to last a good amount of time. I think this product is a GREAT value considering how many batteries you get for the price, they are reliable and durable as far as I have used them. Great bargain!",1
"Originally I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds. They loved it and so did I. So many things to do on them and so much of what they love. I now got it as well for my 2 year old. The best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have 3 colors to choose from, so perfect for me.",1
Good Price,1
Works great for everyday AA battery needs,1
cant beat price,1
Adequate performance. I just pulled 16 batteries from four night lights. Half of these were the AmazonBasics AA batteries. Not surprising until I tell you that that AmazonBasics batteries were the last to be installed and the other half were installed long before the AmazonBasics. I don't think I'll buy these again.,0
My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!,1
"For the price a great value, will never buy another overpriced brand name battery again.",1
"Never again will I purchase this. The outer cardboard box is frustration-free, but the batteries are tightly shrink-wrapped in groups of four. You need to cut into the wrap to begin to separate the batteries, pull them apart, then cut a little slice into the wrap around each battery. Then figure out how to pull each battery out of its little, plastic strait-jacket.Even if these batteries function well, the hassle of unwrapping them (12 shrink-wrapped sets of four batteries) isn't worth any cost savings.",-1
"This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power.",1
Great batteries. I don't think they last nearly as long as some of the bigger name brands. But can not be beat for price.,1
"very good batteries for a good price, no need for fancy duracell or energizer",1
work just fine,1
Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.,1
"The automatic light adjustment is pretty cool, but I find myself accidentally covering the sensor which really throws it off.I like being able to press the buttons on either side instead of touching the screen. I also appreciate the flat surface, it doesn't seem to attract as much dust in the corners like my other kindles.",1
I just put 4 of these in my flashlight they worked. It is too soon to see how long they will last. I have had great experience with other amazon basics products ( the wireless keyboard mouse set)So I decided to try the batteries-- so far so good,1
"It's hard to love a battery. All I can say is they work, and they seem to last as long as any others. The price is good, so I'm happy.",1
"good batteries for the price. great for remotes and clocks, last a little less in cameras. still a great value for the price!",1
Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.,1
"The battery were pack in a plastic solid thing holding the battery inside of a very well made box. I have not tested the battery but the Do Not list is well thought out. It Has it in English,Chinse,Spanish,Dutch,French and One Other. This has to be why you should buy AmazonBasics battery instead of other people cause their prices higher than in stores for a cheap medium grade battery. I a real person and feel free to ask the oddest question.AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (8-Pack) - Packaging May Vary",1
I bought this for my Don's second birthday and he loves it. My five yr old loves it also. Very easy to use.,1
"FIRST TIME I'VE TRIED AMAZON BATTERIES, SO FAR SO GOOD! I GUESS WE'LL SEE HOW LONG THEY WILL LAST",1
"It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality.",1
The appear to be as good as the rayovac's my kids blow through in the gaming controllers and at a slight savings. I think we'll keep using them!,1
THESE TABLETS ARE PERFECT FOR TODDLERS! I WAS PLANING TO BUY MY 5 AND 3 YEARS OLD AN IPAD BUT CAME ACROSS THESE AND AFTER READING REVIEWS I DECIDED TO ORDER. THE COVERS WORK GREAT SINCE MY 3 YEAR OLD ALWAYS DROPS IT. TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!,1
"The 8"" version is much better than the older 7"" version. Better graphics and faster processor",1
Was happy to get the toy for my son for Christmas and they won't stop playing it,1
This is an affordable set of rechargable Alkaline batteries.,1
"My niece is 2 years old and she absolutely loves this tablet. It's easy for her to use and navigate through. Plus, it has parental controls which I love. Definitely recommend it.",1
item as described.,1
This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up.,1
My child loves playing with the Kindle fire. It is entertaining and educational.,1
These are a great price but they don't seem to last as long as you would expect. Also I have found some are already dead upon arrival.,0
"Great price, fast delivery...what else could you ask for",1
Love this kid's tablet - it's kid proof! It's perfect for kids of all ages!,1
After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.,-1
"It was a fast deliver, the tablets is awsomo and it's a great service",1
Great batteries for a great price. They last just as long as the name brand batteries do.,1
I love it he is three and does everything on it so many learning games he likes to play he does amazing with it,1
"I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far.",1
Some of the batteries did not work well.,0
I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.,0
The ones that work work fine however I've just had to toss eight because they're dead. don't work. not happy,-1
"Tremendous Value! My kids go thru AA batteries at a ferocious pace. Doesn't matter the brand, they burn through them. These last as long as what we'd previously buy at the store, but at a fraction of the price!!!!",1
Have batteries for a long time...they are pretty good...using them with cat coin box..nice...,1
Perfect for my grandson I love the easy to use set up and parental control. I have recommended this to my friend for her children. Case is great,1
So far. So good. Appears to perform as well as the national brands.,1
Nice basic reader. Had the first model kindle and this is quite a bit lighter,1
"So glad I chose to buy this Kindie on BF. It is still a great price regardless for such a quality product. Made well, feels solid not cheap and chency. I love the blue that I got as well as the other color selections. Great job!",1
They work. So far so good.,1
"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most.",1
Good deal from Black Friday sales and will make a very good Christmas gift. Kids edition excellent with the rubber bumper case which provides pretty good protection.,1
no complaints here about Amazon brand products,1
"Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. They do not have a great selection and when I put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won't let you play it",0
last a long time,1
My gf loved it and uses it all the time. She gets books she wanted to follow up on,1
"Some of the best batteries I've ever bought. Last a long time, and VERY nicely packages. Batteries are individually packaged into packs of 4 so that is very nice.",1
Was very convenient to order with a toy that required batteries.,1
work well with no issues. last as long as the name brand,1
Good,1
I was very surprised when the package arrived. These are AA batteries!,1
Works perfectly,1
she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it,1
It's a whole crap load of Aa batteries. They make electricity happen. It's magic,1
"This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!",1
"The item was excellent ,best price,best cost and best store",1
Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.,1
These batteries are exactly what you would expect. I have not had any issues with them not lasting long. I would recommend these to anyone looking to purchase batteries.,1
Great price for quantity!,1
They really don't last very long,0
I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!,1
great quality. Holds nice long charge,1
"features are similar to my fire 6 and this upgrade is good. I wish it was lighter in weight, although I enjoy the larger screen.",1
"I had known Amazon was going to release the next Generation a few weeks after I bought this one! OTOH, my wife is happy with it. It just offended my geek side. However, it has Alexa and integrates well with my Philips Hue equipment.",1
i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done,1
These are wonderful batteries at a great price. Way to go Amazon!,1
Really like this pretty easy to set up I love the bumper also the free time settings when time is up that's that and no figthing with mom. I thought I saw something stating that the free time feature is only free for one year so rating may change if I find this to be true. Would hate to be charged for what the kindle was intended for.,1
Bought this for my 2 year old daughters birthday and she loves it. Easy to use and navigate. Look up some videos on how to install Google store and the tablet is perfect. Case is reliable as I have seen my daughter drop her kindle on carpet and hardwood floors with no damage. Highly recommend,1
I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.,1
These are a great alternative to high priced batteries. Wish I would have come across them sooner.,1
"They do the job at a great price. Also purchase AA, D, 9V all the time for company.",1
"I have a 2 year old son who has plenty of toys that eat through batteries quickly, so I decided to try out this big pack. The batteries last a long time for low power items like tv remotes and audible toys. They run out of charge after a few days on my son's most used toy, a bubble machine. But, he does use it for long periods of time when he plays with it and it has a high power motor. I would say that higher prices batteries last a little longer with his high power toys, but the cheap price for these males up for that. I just added these to our subscription list and will buy the AAA of this brand when I need them.",1
I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!,1
Great batteries for the price! Will definitely buy again.,1
"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it.",1
This tablet is great! My daughter loves it and will not leave home without it,1
Perfect,1
My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.,1
"I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows.",1
Works ok. Doesn't last too long,1
"Great starter to teach young children how to play games with parental control of what game,movie or music sites. And the plastic protector case is included",1
My son and I both love the Amazon fire! He's 8 and plays his games and downloads books. I download books and watch movies and shows,1
"The Tap offers all of the conveniences of Amazon's Alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker. It has a hands free option, it works well both as a way to take Alexa on the road and as your primary Alexa device at home., the Tap doesn't sound as good as other Bluetooth speakers in its price range. It's not waterproof and Alexa doesn't work at all without Wi-Fi. but still pretty cool and heaper than the Echo.",1
Easy to use. Like all of the features. Lightweight.,1
Thank You!,1
My great granddaughter loves it. Easy to use and it holds the charge well.,1
Bought it for my pre-k daughter but my teen-ager daughter took it for a try and she so love it!,1
My son loves it and he's been using/playing with it every after school.,1
Packaged nicely.,1
This is a nice size for holding and viewing. I debated on getting the next size up but glad I didn't. You can also create different profiles. I set up a separate profile for my granddaughter and it allowed me to add restrictions so she can't access certain things or make purchases in apps. It also gave me a 30 day free trial for Amazon FreeTime which has so much content just for children. Happy with the price and product.,1
GREAT PRICE,1
No complaints.,1
Good but screen is not good as other tablet .. great for kids,1
Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.,1
"Great batteries for cheap! Much better than any off brands for a similar price. Last about as long as the name brands, and the bulk amount is nice as well.",1
AmazonBasics batteries strike the perfect balance between cost and longevity. These are awesome.,1
"Great price, work as long as any other battery",1
nice,1
"Good batteries, they perform well.",1
"This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus",1
Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use.,1
"I now have five times as many batteries as when I buy them at the grocery store, for the same price.",1
I love it it comes with a 12 month kids subscription,1
Awesome price on Black Friday! Great tablet for reading and searching the Internet. Has expandable memory slots which is great!,1
Great price to replace all those batteries in electronics. Seems to last about as long as the major brands.,1
A friend recommended the tablet and I am happy with it.,1
"As always with the batteries, you never pay too much. They are priced just right.",1
And I mean that as a compliment lol! I'm actually a long time user of the Sunbeam batteries from my local dollar store. I didn't feel like going out to get more of them this time so I ordered these instead. Looks like those will be my last dollar store batteries cause the AmazonBasics rock! I get the convenience of home delivery and they last about twenty percent longer. Thanks for a great product at a fantastic price Amazon.,1
This is a very good reader for the money. Very versatile.,1
This tablet exceeded my expectations. The price isn‚Äôt too bad either.,1
"2nd time purchasing these battteries. They last a long time in everything i have put them into, baby toys,remotes,game controllers etc. Just as good as the name brand or better, Zer0 Complaints!",1
I bought this as a gift and it has performed perfectly. Can't beat at this price.,1
All my remotes have new batteries,1
We got this for our 9 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn't been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses.,1
"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app",0
Performance at a cheaper price with the Amazon brand.Lasts almost as long as the Duracell brand after a head to head comparison.,1
Love this kid's tablet - it's kid proof! It's perfect for kids of all ages!,1
love it,1
"My grandson loves the Fire 8 Kids. It is durable, and doesn‚Äôt mind being dropped by little hands. His mind stays engaged and car rides are pleasurable once again!",1
"Last just as long or longer than the name brands! I game alot and have been using Duracell or energizer, whichever is on sale. Decided to try these and so far I feel like they have lasted longer than the name brands. Ill update if this changes",1
very good itemfast shipmenthigh quality,1
"My daughter is totally enjoying her tablet.Recently though, it is not charging correctly. I will come to store to have it looked at.",1
Great value.,1
Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.,1
Easy to use tablet for kids. Very durable case. Love it!,1
This was a gift for my girlfriend. She loved due to the fact that it was small and compacted ..,1
Great! Now always have some when Grandkids come from out of state.,1
Batteries. Work well,1
"Great product, works as advertised!",1
"Have installed these in several devices and they are working and lasting fine. I'm always leary of off-brand batteries, but these seem perfectly fine and were a great buy!",1
"Love this tablet, great value, come with great protective case, preloaded apps are an awesome feature. The included 2 year protection is also a plus.",1
great value!,1
I have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised. The case only opens about a third of the way. I have always had computer bags that opened fully. It it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the laptop trying to fit it through the small opening. I recommend spending few extra shekels and buy a case that fully opens.,0
"I needed AAA batteries and it's going to be a while before I get to Costco to get some. I was buying something else on Amazon and decided to get some batteries, to give it a chance. They arrived in 2 days, they were well packaged and sealed, and most importantly, they work great, they hold a charge well, I am very pleased. Excellent batteries.",1
"Seemed to be fine as Chtistmas gift for granddaughter. However, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. Supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. Don't know where to take it.",-1
I've used these for a while now and have always been satisfied. Great price per battery. No need to pay a lot more for name brands for maybe a slightly longer run time.,1
You cannot beat the price! The batteries are of good quality too and last a while!,1
I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use.,1
"I love the kindle and have had one in one shape or another since they first came out, but I just could not take how slow this model was. I returned it and purchased a Samsung tablet.",-1
Good,1
I love that Amazon Basics - why pay more for a brand name of something like batteries.,1
Can't believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from.,1
I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.,-1
"I PURCHASED TWO FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN TO SHARE AND THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THEM, WHICH MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY! I NEED TO BUY HEAD PHONES NEXT!",1
Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture,1
"I LOVE MY KINDLE! I surf the web, take pictures and play games on it. I use it everyday.",1
"bought this as a christmas gift for our son, it holds a lot of games and is very easy to use",1
I had read reviews. It is just like what reviews said. It is really good. I still have to try some features. Probably I should have gone for Kindle Light. Maybe next time. But for now I am totally satisfied.,1
"Of the four used so far, two already lost charge, one so much as giving a negative read on a voltmeter.",0
I usually buy Duracell but decided to try these Amazon batteries. They're good. Not sure I'd remember to buy them again but they worked well for me.,1
terrible,-1
Bought this for my three year old when I bought a new car with no tv in it. She loves that I can download shows and movies and then watch others on wifi.,1
This little $60 tablet is really good for reading ebooks and watching netflix,1
We couldn't be happier. Very light and easy to use. Price is unbelievable.,1
The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.,1
batteries are fresh,1
Great bang for the buck.,1
very good,1
Lasted normal time,1
very good,1
"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all",1
"For some reason I thought I was buying rechargeable ones as these showed up in the results when I typed in rechargeable AAA batteries in the search box. Must not have paid too much attention, oh well. They work as well as the so called high end long lasting brands and I'm still glad that I have them, as it's nice to have extras on hand.",1
Batteries seem fine on arrival and after installing in lanterns. No issues so far.,1
The Kindle Fire is small but does everything it should for a young child. Worth the low cost I paid for it.,1
"Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one.",1
My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them,1
This speaker has some kick. The sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out,1
Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.,1
"lots of games, love that it has the option to use as a regular tablet, and my kids love the case because it makes it easier to hold and to prop it up when they are listening to books and such! Has parental controls and is all around awesome for kids!!!!",1
Great quality and great price!,1
I bought this for my niece and she loves it. Works great.,1
you get what you pay for... they are not great,0
Bought for my 2 yr old grandson.. and he loves it has a lot of learning numbers alphabet and shapes,1
The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!,1
Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.,1
"They don't seem to work except in very low energy items. Can't get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well",-1
Work fine but run out an it quickly.,1
Great value and they last just as long to me.,1
"So far so good, will keep buying Amazon Basics batteries.",1
Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.,1
I bought some to my friend as gifts.The product are all very good.,1
Good for the money.,1
"You can never have enough batteries! They work well, plenty of life.",1
It's a battery and it works :).,1
Awesome for the price. Lasts as long as the name brands,1
Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I 'm interested in.,1
"Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train.",1
I purchased this as a gift for my mother. Her first tablet and she loves it. Easy for her to navigate.,1
"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",1
The batteries work great and the expiration date freshness is good.,1
I was pleased to see they are each marked with an approximately 10 year shelf life.,1
The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.,1
Excellent tablet for the price. Use it mainly for watching Amazon Prime movies etc. Would not recommend for heavy gaming. Just a fun tablet for the money.,1
We purchased this tablet for out 8 year old and he loves it. Amazon d's products are Solid.,1
"Purchased for 8 yr old daughter. It's easy for her to use and allows me to set time limits on her game, internet and streaming.",1
"I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it!",1
"It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though.",1
Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages,1
These are great quality at an even better price. I am always rummaging through the junk drawer in desperation when the remote dies mid Netflix binge. Now I can binge on for all eternity!,1
"On time, product as advertised.",1
"Bought these in late Nov. By March 1, most of them were dead in the package.",-1
This was a gift for my toddler grandson. He loves it.,1
Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...,0
"Durable , worth every penny, got it for our 2 year old daughter , amazed how easily she can navigate it",1
"Buy these! Great deal, good performance. Repeat purchase.",1
Great product,1
Haven't use the batteries at this time and expect 5 star performance.,0
"In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking.",-1
worth every penny. Its fast and loaded with lots of apps.,1
This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.,1
This is for my 5 year old and she hasn't put it down since Christmas. She uses it for watching videos and taking pictures of her toys..,1
This was easy to setup and easy to hand over to my 4 yr old. She loves the different games and apps that are available to her.,0
One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.,1
"I'm glad that I bought this product, it's easy to understand, my grandkids loves it.",1
"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow.",1
I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!!,1
Love love love !,1
My daughter loves it. Much faster than her last tablet.,1
I bought this tablet for myself because I bought the 8 gb one for my 6 year old and was so impressed with it that I bought myself the 16 gb one,1
thanks,1
I'm always satisfied with these batteries,1
"Must have for people who have an Amazon Prime account and an Echo. Portability and water resistant. Works great by the hot tub or pool, and let's you access the normal Alexis capabilities.",1
Very good,1
great price for batteries don't see any difference between these and the higher priced name brands,1
GREAT QUALITY,1
great for the price but don't last long but the quantity makes up for it,1
Great deal on batteries..Will orderd more!! Long battery life.,1
These batteries did not even last a day with some LED lights we used. I do not recommend these to anyone. Go with a good brand name.,-1
"Good quality, prompt arrival.",1
I really like that my child is engaged with all of the different apps we have downloaded.,1
Ordered the Triple AAA battery pack and I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or what but pretty much not a single battery works. What a waste of money so they definitely deserve one star.,-1
"This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok",1
"Triple A batteries , not much to say other than I was happy with the convenience that Amazon offers. No issues and am happy with my purchase",1
Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.,1
Can't beat AmazonBasics.,1
"good quality, good price!",1
Need to definitely get a memory card. Not enough memory to hold kids apps.,1
Works Great!,1
"Better loading, longer battery life, clearer picture, more space. Still just as durable!",1
Nice price nice quality,1
Ok,1
I think this is a great product and I would recommend it.,1
"Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read.",1
"Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire",1
fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!,1
good batteries nice price,1
Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend,1
"I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need!",1
Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.,1
I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email,1
"Very good, like to keep in stock",1
returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.,0
My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos.,1
"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself.",1
I think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with I also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all-around Device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it,1
My granddaughter LOVES it! LOTS of kid-friendly apps for a 5 year old!,1
"Good batteries, good price",1
the device works flawlessly... nearly indestructable for a 2 yr old... also comes with a no questions asked replacement policy through Amazon in the event that the screen breaks or something crazy,1
like,1
The don't last as long as I'd hoped.,0
The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!,1
This item works great and fitst anywhere. I have no complaints...,1
Good value,1
"I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price.",0
"Good knob. Looks good. Logo faded/wore off in a few months though... logo is kinda why I bought this, so..........",0
Great deal and last as long as the major brands,1
Very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it,1
"I was a bit hesitant to order these because, you know, low priced batteries. But guess what Good quality batteries at a low price. What more could you ask These are as good or better than Duracell for less money.Well, go ahead and get them! You KNOW you'll need them.Go ahead.",1
As advertised,1
Good,1
Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.,0
They do not last,-1
"works fine. don't know if they are better than name brands, but they do job for me.",1
Value is great,1
I Luke it a lot and good to for it for and good to,1
"Got 2 of these for my two oldest daughters, 5 and 3. Perfect for them and love the features. Battery life seems pretty long. The year of freetime plus the case makes it worth it! Will be getting another for my 3rd daughter's 2nd birthday.",1
gteat value,1
"Definitely are inexpensive, but we seem to go through them very, very fast. So... not sure.",0
"The best deal on AA batteries you can find! They work great, and I'll definitely be buying more once I go through this large amount!",1
Great product at very reasonable price!,1
Finally I have enough batteries! A nice supply of batteries that seem to last as good as any and better than many. They came in a package that was good for storing them. A very useful battery as many products use them today.,1
"Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price",1
Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet,1
I have owned a kindle before & prefer it to an ipad,1
"There are many apps and books available for free with this tablet, so it is very entertaining. It makes shopping online easy too with the Amazon store app.",1
This was a gift and so far myMom loves it. She plays on it all the time.,1
Tablet is great for child. Plenty of space to store his music and games. Nice size screen,1
"Great buy, fast delivery",1
"If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets.",1
"Great batteries that last as long as the named brand ones do, if not longer.",1
"Don't last quite as long as name brand, but worth the money.",1
Great pack of batteries. What can I say It's a great big box of AA batteries. Power is good!,1
Gets it done and looks shiny in the process,1
Standard batteries at a better price.,1
These batteries last as long if not longer than other top name brands. This is the only way I buy batteries now. They are conveniently delivered to my door at an excellent price.,1
Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.,1
arrived fast. Works well.,1
Great Value.,1
"I purchased these batteries for my boyfriend . The split open and ruined who uses them in a 200.00 portable modem. I would of sent them back, but this happened after the 30 day return window.",-1
There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.,0
My Grandson loves his tablet we got him. Very safe,1
"I bought this 8"" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7"" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8"" Amazon Fire HD. Can't beat the price for a Tablet.",1
"Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service",1
"This is a great tablet. I got it on Black Friday at an amazing price. The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine.",1
All are working as they should. Very good purchase.,1
"The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids.",1
I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.,1
The kids love it and easy to understand. Great parental controls as well.,1
Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.,0
Got this for my 3 year old son. He plays with it every now and then but it's good for introducing him to educational things. Glitchy at times but that's to be expected with how much it cost.,1
"The basic AA batteries that can only do its job well. I haven't tested it about it's life span yet, but seems not bad, as you can have a great number of them to use for a long time!they are excellent kind batteries for the price, though it is not better than some other it is as good quality of most brands. because you just have pay extra money for the brand which is a waste of money.I don't have any reason to pay a higher price product.",1
"Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet.",0
Good purchase. I always like to order form Amazon.,1
"I already had the Kindle Fire 7"", and this KF8 not only has a bigger picture screen but is faster.",1
Cant beat these for the price and seem to last as long as the copper top batteries in my TV controller.,1
I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.,1
Bought two for gifts. A huge hit!! They are readers and love not having to lug books.,1
"Easy to use!! Purchased for my nephew, he's 4, he loves it.",1
These batteries won't last long. An led flashlight will drain them in a hurry. I usually like Amazon products but this is one to avoid.,-1
Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features.,1
"Batteries die quicker than Dollar store batteries. Used these batteries on various products -toothbrush, computer mouse, camera flash, etc. Batteries at best lasted half as much compared to Energizer and Duracell. Would not recommend!",-1
So convenient to order these! I will be buying my batteries from Amazin from now on!,1
"Good batteries, cheap price. What's to review",1
The quality of the display is amazing - the battery life is fantastic,1
"Husband loves the 8"" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading",1
The device is so simple for kids. It is great. I love the case it's really protective.,1
"so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though.",1
It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.,1
I am really enjoying it !! Love it ! Sales person was also great,1
The kids really enjoy this. They play for hours on them. Keeps them occupied.,1
just as good as duracell,1
"I love this tablet and so do my children! I have been wanting to get one for a couple years but never had any wifi to use it with all the features, and trust me i bought every other kids tablet there was along the way. My daughter will be 6 this year and this is easily her 10th tablet i got all the ones for kids with the pre loaded apps and learning games. From nabi to samsung kids tablets and everything in between. These are by far the best. Very easy to use and my daughter loves all the games on them she plays for hours and the battery lasts a long time too, all the other tablets battery would die after an hour! This one just keeps going! Even my 2 year old son cant get enough of the books and learning games. I also like that it comes with a free year of free time for kids and if it breaks for any reason within 2 years they will replace it. All the other tablets broke after only a year or less, just stop working or glitch out. Trust me this tablet us worth it! Give it a try! You wont be sorry.",1
Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.,1
I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.,1
"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",1
Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids,1
I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there,0
"Best bang for buck on batteries, and always good to have a small stock of them on hand for whatever you might need.split this with my roommate, and so we now each have some AAA and we also split a pack of AA, great for the controllers that dont get used regularly, toys, remotes, whatever, if you plan ahead, it is worth it.",1
Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.,0
Very good,1
Excellent,1
always happy with the amazon basics batteries as they live up to expectations and the price is right,1
It has been a great product for our son. Easy to use and excellent for learning and playing games. Video quality is very good as well.,1
"This is a quality product, well constructed with durable materials. Many pockets for laptop accessories or other supplies. Sometimes I use it as just a briefcase and it also serves that purpose well. All in all, it's a great value for a reasonably low price.",1
"I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses.",1
We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.,0
Perform as exxpected.,1
Great product,1
I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.,1
"I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It's a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well.",1
Love this tablet have had several others but this brand works everytime..very happy with my purchase,1
Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho,0
"Work fine, very good price, good batteries! Word to the wise check the good to date on the Batteries, if possible! Some places lower the prices when close or past good to date. Past a good chance or bad of leakage.",1
great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday,1
"To begin with this is the best reader available right now. Brighter than the pw2. Just awesome. Whether or not its a worthwhile upgrade from the paperwhite is another topic. Either way, it's a great piece of hardware- light, good grip, light etc. there is one HUGE issue however! The background light is not uniform- it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device. For a $200 device thats unacceptable! How much that bothers u will be subjective and u wont notice it as much once u get into your book. The problem was present on all 3 devices I purchased (and returned), to the exact same degree. I kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like its a production issue. Going through amazon reviews, various online forums- it seems to be present on a large number of devices if not all. Amazon refuses to address the issue, probably because they'll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product, like the iphone antenna problem bottom line- great device, but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue (youtube it if u cant visualize what I'm talking about, tons of videos out there describing it) . How bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck, or which batch your local bestbuy has stock from, and most importantly it will bother you / what youre willing to settle for. In my case, i hated it but there was no alternative- the pw2 seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head comparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it. If thats a problem for you, wait for the 2015 edition. The pw1 had this issue apparently and it was addressed quietly by amazon in the pw2.",1
Works well and looks great for kids. Limited internet access though.,1
Great batteries. Affordable. I would not buy this from local stores which charges double or triple the price of this for similar or lower quality items.,1
"My daughter absolutely loves her new tablet. And it does do everything I wanted it to do for her. The free year of Amazon Freetime is an awesome bonus!! The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. This happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old. I wish that could be fixed because other than that, the tablet is GREAT for my daughter and she has so much fun with it!! I'm sure other kids will love it also!!",1
"Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again.",1
"in my eyes, they die to quickly",1
"My daughter is learning so much from the games on this device, my wife was glad I bought it.",1
I bought this for my toddler and its perfect. He is rough with it and it still works. I wanted something that I use to teach him the basics of using a tablet and this worked great. It comes with a 2 yrs warranty.,1
It's a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy,1
My son is very happy with this and so are mommy and daddy. No more asking for our phones and setting the time limit is awesome,1
"I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone.",1
Ok,1
This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners.,1
So far so good--and no problems anticipated!I really like the packaging--groups of 4 in plastic wrappers makes them easy to maintain in the package.,1
My son is a huge fan of it and I love that I can control what he watches and plays,1
"An excellent tablet for the price. Just remember that Amazon is using it to try to sell you stuff. And not all apps are available in the app store, just the ones Amazon wants you to see",1
"These batteries work for normal things. But when i tried to use them for a dog collar that is supposed to help with barking, they were too weak and had to be changed after three uses. Annoying.",-1
My eight year old loves the games and it is safe for her to use.,1
Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.,1
"so far, the batteries match the quality of named brands.",1
"great value, why pay for expensive brand when Amazon basic sufficient your basic needs :D",1
Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.,1
Yup!,1
We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.,1
"Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon",1
Great quality. Love it!,1
"Great tablet, especially for the price. I bought this to replace an old Fire 7 tablet, that I had the battery going down. It works nicely and I love the Kindle Freetime and the parental control settings.",1
"Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now.",1
It does everything well. Easy to use and a great size. This is my first tablet and I made a very good choice.,1
"Never had alkalines that die as fast. This has been consistent through the package, not just a couple of batteries. Same results when used in TV remotes, optical mouse, smoke detectors and small flashlights.",-1
Worked great and will be reordering.,1
Just as good as the name kind,1
Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.,1
bought this for my 6 year old grandson who's a bit rough but loves to play games and read...he loves it,1
"My kid loves d Tablet n it's serving d mean aim of buying it, it's very educational.eady to operate.",1
Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it.,1
As described by Amazon Basics. These last a good while.,1
was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store,1
Great sound in a small package for the money and I would buy again.,1
The color is great. The price is even better the battery life is good. No complaints,1
"Worst product. Have to trash it out, because I was so upset. Did not serve the propose I bought it for.",-1
Great battery,1
Great product at very reasonable price!,1
I wanted the technology but didn't want something that listens to the ever-present conversation in my home. The Amazon Tap fit the bill since one must tap its button to get it to listen.It works and works very well.,1
Good quality alkaline batteries.,1
nice,1
LOVE Amanzon Basics batteries!,1
i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store. wish it had google play.,1
I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it.,1
It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids.,1
"Gave as a gift.Did not know you had to ""tap"" it before you talk. Thought it was like echo.Anyway, they still love it and does not mind pushing the button to talk.Really likes that it is battery powered, portable.",1
Good. bought about 20 packs so far. no complaints yet.,1
This is my first kindle and I have been very pleased with it for what I payed for it.,1
"Seems to work well I haven't been using them long, but have not had any problems",1
Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work.,1
"I love the box they come in, I also love that they are amazon brand.",1
"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy.",1
"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed.",1
Good deal,1
Good deal on a great product!,1
I liked it so much I will e getting all my grandkids one for birthdays from now on.,1
This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back,-1
Very Good.......Thank You.........Jose,1
"I read the reviews before purchasing this so I went into it knowing there will be apps pre-loaded that I will have to remove. That being said, I purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and no-hassle protection guarantee.",1
Awesome batteries for an awesome price. I will never buy any other brand of battery's from now on they work great and last very long . I use the batteries for my kindle firestick remote so not sure how long they last in other things but they lasted almost a year in my remote before running out of battery,1
Kindle fire is a good product. I am happy with my purchase. The only difficulty was buying books. It was difficult to understand initially.,1
"What happened to the green and silver amazon batteries Those worked great. These new ones are terrible. Very short battery life. I've been through two boxes of 48, thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time, same results.",-1
I love the fact that this Kindle has an expansion slot so I can add memory for movie and music (and book!) downloads! Awesome!,1
Just what I needed.,1
"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy.",0
Proper sized (unlike generic batteries) with lots of power.,1
The price of these batteries are unbeatable for the amount you get. They perform very well and last a while. Will be buying all my batteries from Amazon going forward,1
Bought this for my six year old grandson. The set up was very easy. He is able to download kids only stuff and can send us videos of himself using the app. He just loves it. Truly kid friendly.,1
"Boxed well, easy to set up, and pretty easy to get the hang of.",1
It worked great I like it you can't beat the price you get a lot for your money,1
"For the price, it's tough to get a better tablet than the Kindle Fire. It's not the same quality as higher priced tablets, and you're locked into Amazon's ecosystem, but if you're an Amazon Prime member and are looking for an affordable tablet, the Kindle Fire is a good choice.",1
Batteries seem to work okay. Too new to determine how long they will last.,1
I've started to allow this device to grow on me. Yes I saw some color variation but either my eyes have adjusted or it's gone away. I'm back to reading like I used to and love it!,1
Not sure what else to say other than these are cheap batteries. Great price.,1
Decent tablet to give to someone without a hefty price tag,1
"Alexa do ........something? Welcome to the new interconnected world Circlers! Do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command? This may be for you! Do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopia of David Eggers ""The Circle"" and you want to escape from technology for a while? Then likely not, as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on Echo and Echo Dots, your life is still connected to Alexa via voice prompts! I liked using it for Amazon music, and the occasional Amazon Video, but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an Uber. Some people may feel they need technology to run their lives, I am not quite there yet and may never be! It is fun for what it does though, and it is a good bluetooth speaker!",1
This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints.,1
"Arrived quickly, good value.",1
"great deal, used these to run my trail camera for several months.",1
Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.,-1
Have some issues with library check out and Amazon.,1
"These work pretty well, we used them for long term use in our Christmas candles for the whole month of December and they lasted the whole month.",1
For the price I believe this is an excellent tablet .,1
"like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader.",1
I bought this tablet for it's inexpensive price and quality. it's meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from Amazon and services but it really is a high-quality product.,1
blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you,1
WILL BUY AGAIN,1
"Don't last as long as Duracell, but you can't beat the price",1
I actually had a kindle. But I have grand daughters and they always want to play with it when they come over .. Soo removed all my books from it and put their games on it and got me a new one for me... Now we are all happy. They watch you tube and Netflix and play games. It's a win win.,1
"Works great, makes a great gift! .................",1
amazon branded products are usually very good.,1
"This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.",1
these work as well as any others,1
Good deal for a lot of batteries. Definitely worth the money,1
"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!",1
good,1
No Comments,1
Did the job.,1
"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!",1
"I bought this tablet for my granddaughter. She loves it, it's easy for her to use, and just right for her size.",1
"This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!",1
This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.,0
I like the design and easy to navigate. The case provides good protection.,1
Many great improvents over my previous kindle from 4 years ago. It's easy to use and really affordable.,1
Seems to work like every other battery. Just less expensive!,1
"Great tablets, prefer over the Nabi anyday. Love the color choices",1
yay batteries,1
This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.,1
GOOD BATTERIES,1
"The kids tablet made a good gift for our youngest grandson, 6 years of age.",1
"This is my 4th Kindle, and the worst so far. It randomly locks up and require a restart to do anything. I've probably had to do this a dozen times in the last week. It's going back if they'll take it.",-1
I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.,-1
Works like the name brands but at an unbeatable price!,1
The batteries are great and for the quantity and price it's a great buy.,1
"They're batteries, and they power my stuff",1
"I love the portability of this expandable file good quality, good cost. I recommend",1
"purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it.",1
I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..,-1
"This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all!",1
"Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use.",1
"I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it.",1
It has been a great product for our son. Easy to use and excellent for learning and playing games. Video quality is very good as well.,1
reliable,1
Working just fine,1
"Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great",1
I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack,1
"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Works great for YouTube, Netflix and adding a few games. Easy to learn how to use and no ""accidental"" purchases can be made if you use the option to switch user accounts.",1
"I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!",1
It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use,1
"I bought this for my daughter to use. I know the regular amazon fire is cheaper, but this one came with a bumper, a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kids to read lot of books and play great games for free. In the end it's a great deal.",1
Works well and looks great for kids. Limited internet access though.,1
"these apparently have been sitting around for some time, I used 2 in a TV remote and they were almost dead within just a few days. I exchanged the two for two more from the same pack, and again about 3-4 days later they were dead. hereafter I'll buy a name brand.",0
love it,0
I bought this for my grandson for his 1st birthday. I was unsure if he would be able to play on it but he does with ease. And it has withstood multiple drops and stool working great!,1
"Definitely are inexpensive, but we seem to go through them very, very fast. So... not sure.",0
We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected.,1
Best tablet ever and our daughter loves the different color.,1
They seem to work well. I have not tried to determine how long they last.,1
"Its great in everyway,, has so.mamy different games and movie choices",1
"They all come in a box wrapped 4 in a bunch. You always have newly packaged batteries and not a mess rolling around, like the ones energizer sells that are all put together. Don't last as long as Energizer but still pretty long!",1
I can lock the screen so he can't mess anything up while I'm playing him an educational video plus built in case to handle and accidents this tab is golden,1
What can I say battery's,1
"good product for youngsters, provides learning and fun together",1
Very affordable.,1
Great,1
"So far I have had no complaints with these batteries. I was hesitate at first because they were cheaper than your big name brands. I figured they may not last long. But I was proven wrong. They have lasted just as long as the big name brands, and they are a lot cheaper. I buy these for work and for home. They do not disappoint me at either place.",1
good,1
"The kids never put them down, Plenty of apps to keep them interested. Parental locks keep them safe.",1
Many of the batteries are no good.,-1
These batteries are a steal. They are just as good as the leading brands at a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended.,1
Great table I pay cheap price is gift for my son my son is happy,1
Easy to use for books and audio. Will use on vacation.,1
.Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet,1
AOK-AS ORDERED,1
Fair price,1
garbage,-1
Great battery just as good as the name brands.,1
"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have",1
We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.,1
"My wife bought the 7"" version for reading. After seeing how easy it was to add movies on an SD card I bought this one for myself.",1
"Found no difference from brand name batteries. Lasts just as long, easier to manage packaging, and it's almost one third of the price.",1
best deal on AA batteries,1
she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it,1
ALWAYS GOOD,1
"My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose.",1
good deal good buy,1
Some were nearly dead out of the box,-1
Purchased for young girl and she love it. Perfect for games,1
"WONDERFUL PRICE! As I buy these on the subscribe and save monthly plan. Thus the price is unbeatable. The product itself does the job just as described.LOVE THE SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE monthly discount plan Amazon offers.Glad this product is available on the program. ONLY WISH THERE WERE MORE ITEMS AVAIABLE TO ADD TO THE SUB SAVE PROGRAM bc I would definitely order more!Overall this product does its job well, It is well priced due to the Sub Save program and I will continue to receive this item every 5-6months",1
As described.,1
"Can't seem to say enough about this awesome stand. This allows me to utilize my laptop monitor and a second flawlessly. The cord keep on the back is great as well. I am about to purchase another monitor and with the choices of adjustment angle, this stand should place the two screens side by side perfectly for that one as well.There is no vibration through the metal as the contacts on the bottom are padded. The fan on my laptop almost never comes on even during day long uploads to the cloud due to this stand having it suspended in air on mesh.Very, very glad I made this purchase. Easily worth much more than I paid, the options for adjustment angles are ample, and lets my expensive baby run cool. Buy with confidence!",1
"I really like the product I bought, it‚Äôs up to date and many functions.",1
"Will give it 5 stars because of the price. I will update later if batteries do not last long. Looking for technical info sorry, that is not me.",1
"This was purchased to give as a Christmas gift. It's no iPad, of course, but that's not really the idea. It's a strong performer for the money and, in our case, allowed an Amazon Prime member, who didn't have a tablet, to enjoy some entertainment when traveling or hanging around the house for the first time. Made a great gift, he's very pleased.",1
"Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets.",1
"I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100!",1
"They're batteries, and cheap. So far they've worked great!",1
"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. They all have problems working and the batteries have to be replaced after one use. Waste of time for what you get.",-1
Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product.,1
product as described,1
"Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +.",1
"Excellent power and price. You can't beat this deal on high quality batteries. Even the club warehouse prices for their own store brands are more expensive than these.They provide more than adequate power for everything we've used them for.They work very good for small flashlights too.Seriously. You are not going to find a better deal for high quality, reliable alkaline batteries anywhere.",1
You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.,1
I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound,0
Nice tablet for my one year old daughter...however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.,1
"I don't have any little kids , however the big boys seem to ear these batteries just as quickly. Price was great. Satisfied our' needs.",1
As if Amazon had to be any better at anything else. These batteries are great. I was skeptical but you can't beat the price and they last a long time. Must have if you have kids and their toys that require a lot of batteries.,1
good,1
This tablet keeps them occupied. Other kids enjoy it while they are around with them. It keeps them entertained.,1
"This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded!",1
love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up,1
"I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight.",1
"Relatively inexpensive (I guess the multiplack of Kirkland batteries sold by Costco would be cheaper, but I didn't want to buy a ton of these, I needed them quickly and they were delivered right to my Mom's house in two days....well worth it), and they seem to work well...only time will tell if they hold up in the Fulcrum 30010-301 LED Battery-Operated Stick-On Tap Light, Silver, 3 Pack I purchased along with them",1
My daughter loves it keeps the kids occupied. I would recommend to anyone with kids,1
It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!,1
"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",0
"I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks.",1
Only reason is I meant to get AAA not AA :(,0
Great price for these AAA batteries!,1
"Good price, decent battery life",1
"Excellent, cheap product.",1
GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.,1
Perfectly fine batteries,1
Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.,1
My daughter loves this tablet. Can watch netflix and youtube on the go if u have moblie hotspots or wifi.,1
Awful poor performance. My mouse ran for several weeks to several months from Duracells but have never gotten more that several days from these. Will not buy again.,-1
They're batteries. That charge done of my things.,1
I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel.,1
Good quality,1
"Good price. When new, they tested on the low end of good with my voltmeter. I'll add to my post after I've had a chance to test battery life.",0
I bought it for my fianc and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.,1
Great price!,1
Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.,1
Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it,1
Great price.,0
"Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well",1
good but they dont last for long time,1
"Great value, work as expectedFit as expected in devices",1
"I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK.",0
I love my Amazon Fire 8 tablet. So easy to download books and movies. Great for trips!,1
When in ordered there batteries I was not sure what to expect. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I tested each and everyone one for voltage which was 1.61V and made in Indonesia. The last batteries I purchased were Energizer's Industrial grade which also carried the same 1.61 volts. The expiration date on these Amazon basics AAA's is 2027 so I expect them to have a good shelf life I believe these batteries will perform every bit as well as the energizers I last purchased. I took advantage of the snail mail delivery I received a 5 Amazon credit which made this deal even better. From the reviews I've read I would highly recommend purchasing these batteries over any name brand for General use purposes as I'm not sure how they would stand up too I drain situations. But I will get back to you on that one with my next purchase.,1
Well worth it for the price..,1
Great batteries and can't beat this price.,1
Put together mobile but it refuses to turn. Kind of pointless. Next time would spend a few more dollars and get something more sturdy and reliable.,-1
"I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it, so i love it.",1
Great lasted about a month and a half running four hours a night in me led candle,1
This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books !,1
Good,1
"What can I say, if you enjoy books and magazines it's hard to beat. Not backlit but not an issue for me. I take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much.",1
"Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls",0
The batteries are great! They work well and the price point can't be beat. I especially love that these come on my subscribe and save order and I no longer pay for batteries at the check out counter in the grocery store.,1
I like that I can order these on-line with Prime shipping directly to my house in a few days. I use a lot of batteries during the holidays starting with Halloween through Easter. Not a bad price and they seem to last awhile.,1
Perfect. Thank you,1
great price works great!,1
They are great at a great price.,1
Very good!,1
Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.,0
"This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer.",1
I absolutely love the parental controls on this device. You can even set a time limit on how long they can use it.,1
Great amount of batteries for the price of them.,1
Plenty to go around,1
"Great for the kids, and has a good battery for how much they use it",1
I love these batteries. Such a great deal. We buy them all the time! !,1
"I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste.",1
I bought this tablet for my 8 year old....when going on long cars rides it's nice to keep them entertained. It was a great value.,1
Good batteries at a good price. They do the job. I've moved almost everything to AAs and need to keep disposables for hurricane season (no power for weeks) These are just right.,1
So far so good testing fully charged,1
"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?",1
"Great batteries at a fraction of the price at local stores. Two batteries last 1 week in a mybaby HoMedics SoundSpa On-The-Go, playing 12 hours each night.",1
"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for.",1
My 3 year old loves it. Several learning apps and can keep children entertained for several hours,1
I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.,1
5 stars,1
Will update but no issues so far. Good deal on batteries.,1
"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. If they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and letchall know.",0
Good loud sound. Very good speaker. Convenient voice commands to take outside of house.,1
Great tablet for young children. Parental locks so you can control what they see. A great deal of educational apps.,1
Great value for the money,1
It's a descent tablet for basic web browsing and videos.,1
good product and will order more.,1
Bestbuy is always on top of any other brands interms of offer and quality of product as always,1
These are just as good as name brand.Will always purchase these from now on.,1
My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven't missed a beat.,1
A great deal for the price. Let's hope these alkaline last longer.,1
They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets,1
"Cheap batteries for the win! They work. They last a reasonable amount of time. I can't compare to other brands because I don't track batteries that closely, but they last long enough for me. I would buy again.",1
I'm not one for reviewing usually but my oh my do i love this thing. It is lightweight and amazing!! I LOVE HOW CRISP IT IS AND HOW BRIGHT IT IS.,1
"So far, so good! Very happy with how long these batteries last.",1
great speedy we'll see how they work,1
"Great value! They last just as long as any battery I could have gone and bought, but by planning ahead, I believe I ended up with a better value! Note...I bought these when Amazon had them on sale!",1
"Good price, Easier to order them on here than to remember to buy them at the store.",1
Great product,1
Great price and they hold up for awhile with my kids toys!,1
Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.,1
Item is as advertised,1
Solid batteries.,1
great price for so many batteries good quality,1
Great set of batteries no complaints and long lasting!,1
So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all,1
I like the fire tablet it's very easy to use and visuals are very good.,1
"Great batteries and great price. Thanks Amazon (and by the way, if you're listening, please make an entire Amazon Basics store so Prime Members can shop in there exclusively).",1
"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad.",1
The kids loved the tablets. They have many games that they play on their new tablet that they can't play on their other devices because they cost money. Great tablet!,1
If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.,1
Batteries + Amazon Awesome,1
This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up.,1
"I purchased these batteries hoping they could hold their own amongst my other portable powered devices. Low and behold, I put these in a talking teddy bear and it proceeded to beat up the Energizer powered bunny in my house.",1
Love it!! My two year old loves to watch Sesame Street & football,1
received earlier than expected and was very happy. Will continue to buy at Best Buy in the future,1
Good batts good price. Would repeat.,1
These did not fit my device...,-1
received as described,1
"Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound.",1
"He figured it out in no time. Be sure to combine all non-child approved apps into a folder. My only complaint is the 1 year free Amazon Freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. Not everyone has home wifi. Anyway, that's my only complaint.",1
This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.,1
good to have around,1
Got this for my 3 year old son. He plays with it every now and then but it's good for introducing him to educational things. Glitchy at times but that's to be expected with how much it cost.,1
Kindle just keeps getting better. This device is the perfect size to pack away for a business trip to kill some time reading a book or even uploading your documents to access them quickly.,1
love it great for kids my son loves it and wont put it down,1
"I went through all 48 in less than 2 weeks. I can't lie and say they were awesome, when they were not.",-1
"Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend.",1
"Works well, some issues with installing Google Play apps. Great battery life",1
"Works better than the 7"" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot.",1
Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment.,1
It was a gift and she really loved it. It was an in-store service clerk that educated me on this product..,1
Great batts!,1
as good as Duracell and the Bunny,1
The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.,1
We tried these batteries out but they're trash. They lasted only 2-3 weeks in our tivo remotes which is amazing as we don't watch that much tv.,-1
"Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage.",1
"Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Impressed.",1
Good deal,1
"Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast. Alexa.",1
I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.,-1
great value,1
"I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach.",1
I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.,1
Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.,0
"Needed badly for so many appliances, work well and will hopefully last long!",1
Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!,1
I like this and the price is right enjoying it now,1
"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet.",1
I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!,1
This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.,1
hope they last long,1
I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.,1
Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.,1
They are batteries. They work.,1
Drains out quickly like cheap dollar tree stuff,-1
"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it.",1
Tablet works pretty good. I purchased it since I was a to make two accounts. One for myself and one for my child. Goo buy!!,1
"I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear.",1
They're batteries and they work. Woohoo! I'll stop buying the junky ones at Dollar Tree. Good deal here on Amazon.,1
"Don't seem to last as long as the big name brands, however, for the price you will get more run time per money spent.",1
"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write",1
All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!,1
"We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals",1
Great so far.,1
My son loves his tablet. He proudly proclaims to everyone he meets to check out his cool tablet. He especially loves the Freetime app.,1
This was a Christmas present so it hasn't had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up,1
DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. What a disappointment. Threw them away. :(,-1
"Excellent buy for the money. And with a 10 year storage Life Expectancy, you can't beat it.",1
Great batteries for the price. Haven't had any problems yet.,1
as strong as other brand name and generic batteries,1
"This is a good deal, and it's alot of batteries for the price. Ten year shelf life is great, even 4 or 5 years would be good, so if they last 10 that's even better.",1
This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can't beat it..,1
"Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,",1
I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.,1
"Batteries came charged, I guess that's a good thing",1
Love these tablets so much. This is the third one I purchased for someone else in the family,1
It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.,1
Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.,1
Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don't want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop.,1
These batteries seem to last as long as the name brands you would purchase at the store. I have saved a lot of money by buying these in bulk instead of running to the store every time I need batteries. I am happy with these and will probably order more when I run out.,1
Great batteries at a lower cost per battery than main stream manufacturers. Highly recommend giving them a try!,1
if you use batteries like I do I would recommend these. Much cheaper than buying locally and just as good if not better,1
They seem to last as good as Duracell procell,1
"Great, non-expensive item for my kids to us and not destroy my Ipad.",1
good battieries,1
They're batteries that do what they're supposed to do and last a long time. What else is there to say Will happily buy these again. :),1
We brought this as a replacement for the fifteen to fifty books my daughter wanted to take with her to Hawaii. Books of course would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloths. Pesky airline and their poundage issues. Now she can take a hundred books and she has a mini computer. It's a win win but no win for the airlines!,1
"Great for the price, the have lasted as long as name brands. I will purchase more in the future.",1
She uses it every day. She can't get enough of it.,-1
"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed.",1
"Okay if you're using for household use, I tried to use with my speedlites for photography and these ran out entirely too quickly.",0
I love to read and using the Kindle has been great.,1
They lasted much longer than most of the other name brand batteries.,1
"Lieutenant Dan got me these batteries. So then I got a call from him, saying we dont have to worry about batteries no more. And I said, thats good! One less thing. -Forrest",1
"I'm not sure if it's coincidence it not but two electronics we've put these batteries in have crapped out within a day of replacing the batteries. When I pulled them out of the remote that completely spazzed out, there was moisture on the batteries. I thought that may have been my fault but then it happened again with a Christmas decoration. I'll probably return them...maybe a faulty batch",-1
I thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a iPad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire,1
"These don't seem to last *quite* as long as Energizer or Duracell, but they are cheaper.",1
I love Fire HD this will be the 4th one I got for my kids and family members.,1
Great product - works exactly as I'd expect!,1
"Bought it for my mom, it was real easy to transfer her downloads from her phone to the tablet..",1
I'm very happy with these batteries. Cheaper than a local deal at a hardware store. They seem to work as well as the name brands. I'm happy with the quality and quantity.,1
"Great product. Excellent for small business, kids etc. Good on the go.",1
I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!!,1
It's a great price but the batteries do not last long at all!,0
Got for reading Amazon books. Works great. Would recommend.,1
This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.,1
"I'm an optimist, and I tend to give 5 Star reviews more than anything. Which I've had people make a comment about that. However, I cannot give a 5-star review on this because it's such a simple unit, and with technology these days it should not be as expensive as it is. That being said, the display will blow your mind, it looks like real paper. I highly recommend.",1
It is a nice tablet for kids and my son enjoys it.,1
Great price for batteries and they do last fairly long.,1
My grand daughter loves it and so do her parents! Very durable. I'd highly recommend this product,1
"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly.",0
"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that.",1
Best place to buy batteries for a great price,1
I like it because is very resistant . The only thing we didn't like is that sometimes it's kinda slow,1
"Great price and Amazon has become a reliable name in our household. You know when you get something that has the Amazon Basics logo on it it will not only work properly it will also last as long or even better than any competitor. Thank you once again Amazon!I think most of the batteries I have in my house are now all AmazonBasics. These batteries are in all of our toys, gadgets, remotes and I have never had an issue. They last as long as expected.",1
I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.,1
My neighbor gave me several of these to use when I was out of AA and needed some ASAP. These are just as good as the name brands alkaline batteries and absolutely no leaks of any kind including the pair I had outside last winter in the LED light. That is why I reordered a couple different times using AmazonBasics for AA and AAA. Recommended highly and easy to order and priced just right!,1
Only wish games worked without internet once downloaded,1
These batteries are great and just the right price.,1
I have to admit I was not too happy with these and probably won't buy them again. The 'life' on them is extremely short and definitely leave a lot to be desired.,-1
My 5 year old loves his tablet. It's perfect for him.,1
i needed new batteries for my camera that didnt cost an arm and a leg,1
I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.,1
This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.,1
Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!,1
"My son has the Hd fire used for last 3 years, I bought this one for my moms birthday. She loves it. It's easy to navigate and the ability to increase the size of the print allows for the smaller screen cheaper price :)",1
Inexpensive and work great!,1
I love my Kindle. It's light and I haven't experienced nnby problems with it thus far. I just wish I could upload my music from Google Play on here,1
For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.,1
"It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side.",1
Good batteries at a good price!,1
This is GREAT for my 3 year old and my 5 year old! They stay entertained and easy to use.,1
The batteries are great and for the quantity and price it's a great buy.,1
So far so good,1
Packaging of the product is perfect. Often when buying batteries in bulk they are not separated. These came in a small box with perfectly wrapped batteries.,1
For the price this is a great tablet. Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.,1
"First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife.",1
love the easy to open packaging! these batteries long very long in my dslr camera!,1
Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad,1
My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!,1
Love the HD8 the extra inch makes a huge difference over the HD7.,1
my 6 year old granddaughter loves her new tablet. she uses it to play games and download movies.,1
I'm using three now and so far they're good. I love the flat sturdy box they came. Perfect for storing. Also a lot more batteries than I realized. :-),1
Needed to get a replacement Kindle for my wife. Did a lot of research online about new generation models of Kindles and sizes. Best Buy had all the models and sizes in stock. And their price was the same as everyone else.,1
buy it not bad for the price at worth it !!,1
I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one,1
Great batteries. Good price,1
I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol,1
"Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money",-1
Decent batteries price wise but don't seem to last as long as the name brand batteries and I assume these are actually some lower end name brand batteries that Amazon has their name stuck on them.,1
Picture quality is not good. I don't like this product,-1
awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use,1
I just put 4 of these in my flashlight they worked. It is too soon to see how long they will last. I have had great experience with other amazon basics products ( the wireless keyboard mouse set)So I decided to try the batteries-- so far so good,1
Fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos,1
"I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!",1
On time and as described.,1
"So these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again.",-1
Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.,1
"Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7"" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift.",1
Work as good as any name brand batteries and a great deal. Not much else to say.,1
"Good price, performing fine so far in all applications I have used them in. Satisfied.",1
I'm very tough on dishwashers and this one seems to be up to the challenge! I will never own another brand!,1
"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet.",1
"This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends!",1
great buy. works well,1
"Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media.",1
The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also.,1
My son washed it twice! Throw it a few times and it's still ticking.,1
Arrived in time as described. Good product.,1
I am very happy with this purchase. Keeps my grandsons entertained. Easy to set up and use.,1
Good value.,1
"I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it's easy for her to read.",1
They work,1
Better then the older models bigger and better then before,1
"This tablet has a lot of features, it really makes it worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account.",1
"The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great.",-1
Perfect for my son! He has fine motor deficits and the games definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them! I also don't have to worry about him getting onto anything that isn't kid friendly since he doesn't know my passcode for the adult profile!!,1
"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option.",1
This tablet is great for games and music. My son enjoys playing games and music on this device.,1
They work,1
"I bought a box of batteries to use in birthday and Christmas presents for the kids. You would never know these weren't big name batteries. They last just as long as the ones you'd buy at big box store, but cost so much less. I haven't used any yet that seemed to die long before they should have.The batteries come in a slim cardboard box which is easy for storing. My only complaint is that they are plastic wrapped in sets of 4 inside the cardboard. While this does make it easy if I have to grab some to take with me, it seems a tad environmentally unfriendly and the plastic is tightly wrapped, making it hard to open.",1
GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE!! I HAVE USED several of these and they have exceeded my expectations.way cheaper then buying name brand at store. I will be buying these again in whatever sizes I need. Thanks amazon!,1
Good batteries. Love them,1
Batteries last a decent amount for things like toys and remotes. The packages come 4 each in a plastic wrap so you don't have to worry about loose batteries floating around after you open the box.,1
Will by there again,1
Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.,1
Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.,1
"Great Batteries at a great price! Love having spare batteries at all times without the high price. Works just as long as the duracell I was paying a very high price for. Try these, you won't be disappointed. Having the big pack, I don't have to worry about buying batteries all the time. Thanks Amazon!",1
"I am an ""old"" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be.",1
"We always seem to be running out of batteries no matter how many we purchase. I have used other Amazon Basics products in the past, so I thought I would give these a try. The batteries appear to be very similar to any other AAA battery one might purchase. I do have a better tester, and was able to confirm the ones I tested were fully charged.We have been using some of the batteries for a week or so now in various items (weight scale / remote), and they appear to be performing just fine. Of course, the real test will be to see if they last as long as the batteries they replaced. But, at least for now, I am going to give them 5-stars based upon how they are currently performing.",1
Love this battery and the price is really reasonable,1
Was lookin for a kids tablet that had enough storage and speed. Love i can run play store apps and amazon apps for my daughter.,1
"These batteries don't last. They might be a good value but for me it's more important to have a battery that lasts longer. Or use these for hiking and rockclimbing and working on my car in the middle the night if I have a flat tire. If you use them like that you want a much better battery like the name brands Duracell, energizer etc. If you just want something that's cheap these batteries are definitely cheap but I bought the 60 count Duracell batteries for .36 each. I think the Amazon ones go for just a bit over .20 each. I think the Duracell's last more than a third longer.",-1
"I love these batteries from Amazon and will continue to buy them for my controllers for gaming as they are strong enough to deal with them. I get a long life from these. As long as I do from my Duracells! I complete this review after either I or an immediate family member has tested the product thoroughly. Sometimes I have very little to say about a product if it works and it does what it is advertised. Sometimes I wax effusive, or rather poetic. Either way please be assured that we have tested the product and have been honest with you. If my review is helpful for you or makes sense, please indicate Yes below. Thank you for reading my review.",1
They do not last very long.,-1
Great buy,1
Good Product.,1
it is good so far. will update again if need to.,1
Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader.,1
"This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product!",1
So far so good for our toddler's toys. Good value if they keep on keeping on!,1
"I've been impressed with the performance and quality of AmazonBasics battery. Though the price point is pretty low, don't let that fool you - they are every bit as long-lasting and durable as the brand-named batteries on the market. In my opinion, there's no reason to spend more on a battery because of it being a name that you're familiar because I can tell you that my experience has been amazing. And honestly, I can't tell the difference between AmazonBasics batteries and other batteries that I've bought in the past that has cost me much, much more money!",1
"What is there not to like Combined with an alkaline battery charger (like the idigital one) it works great and the batteries are really cheap. So what if these get fewer recharges, you get 4x as many for the price. Just don't charge them in a regular charger, it requires a special battery charger that specifically has alkaline support or it will explode.",1
"Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!",1
Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.,-1
"Its a great set up for kids, my daughter loves it and plays it all the time.",1
"This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase.",1
Batteries are decent. I wouldn't consider them better than Duracell or Energizer but the price is right.,0
"I am very happy with my e-reader. It is so practical for reading along with my daughter. she has one as well, and we use them to read every night as required by her 4th grade class curriculum.",1
I bought two for my grand kids. Their parents love them ands so do the kids. Durable and great for steaming video.,1
Great batteries so far. Great price and well worth the money,1
"Best Buy was running a sale on these and I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I'm an Apple guy so Siri has been my ""go to"" virtual assistant. I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better. But none have all the convenience of Alexa, Bluetooth, Wifi and portability in one package.I'll be buying more as Christmas gifts!",1
"Have been using the older kindle fire 7"" for my kids and wanted something to gift. Kindle at this price is a very attractive product. The updates in the hardware are noticible when I compare them to my kids kindle. I gave 4 stars as I am mentally comparing this to a full featured device like the surface or the iPad Pro.",1
exactly what I was looking for. My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up,1
I purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law and she loves it!! It is very easy for her to use and read the screen.,1
Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!,1
"Bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday, I love how easily she can just click and download whatever she wants without bugging me for passwords. The 2 year worry free guarantee is also very nice to have since kids will be kids!",1
Great for small gadgets and remotes. Don't expect to run anythinh more. Could handle a set of battery power hair clippers.,0
It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.,1
This has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed.,1
Super great deal.,1
My almost 4 year old will recieve this for christmas this year but i set it all up prior. I love the parental locks and timers!!!! Soooooo many fun characters for her to choose from to enjoy at every level. The case is soft and light but sterdy!,1
Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy,1
This tablet has many educational games for a preschooler.,1
This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device.,1
"Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words.",1
"This tablet is great if you have Amazon Prime. You really cant beat it for the price. I also have the 7"" version.",1
"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed.",1
"I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad.",1
"Haven't blown up on me or leaked yet. No complaints. Plus, the price is right.",1
"Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it.",1
I think these batteries last just as long if not longer than the other more expensive brands.,1
Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.,1
This is a great tablet for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure it all out. I would recommend going ahead and purchasing a sd card bc the storage space ran out very quickly.,1
Great price and lasts just as long as leading brands of batteries.,1
Good,1
The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!!,1
"Bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it, I have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture,",1
Excelente,1
I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet,1
I wanted something small to read books on on the go. This fit the bill perfectly! Not to big and not to small. It does more things than I was expecting!,1
What can you say it's battery that works good life span. Time will tell if they leak or not. Great Buy!,1
Certainly not as good as Duracell. Some are very good........ others go bad in as little as two weeks. I put 3 in a plugged-in weather radio to serve as battery back up. Got a message that batteries needed replacing after only 2 weeks. A battery tester confirmed that they should be replaced. I guess I will go back to the Duracells.,-1
Like it alot my child likes it so lets see how long itll last her,1
"Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners.",1
Awesome buy. Very happy with these. This is my second order of these batteries. Will continue to purchase when needed.,1
Love the warranty that comes with this! It makes it very conducive for kids to use!,1
Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.,1
I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.,1
These are great for the price!,1
Great price for product. It's get of you have kids.,1
Seem to last as long as other brands.,1
So far they have worked well. I do not know how to compare them on quality yet.,0
This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.,1
"Great value, perfect for what my needs are. Would highly recommend this product. This is the second one I've bought.",1
Small & without audio but easy to use. Able to connect to Amazon account & Goodreads account easily. The only thing I hate is that I have to keep restarting it if I want to get out of a ebook that I‚Äôm currently reading,1
Works as intended. Safety for hard drive that stores my photos.,1
Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you.,1
Best Deal for the price of what you need,1
"These work great. I purchased these to use in my audio recorder for my college class. It is a 4 hour class Mon-Fri and i keep it on the whole time, including the 30 min lunch break, i just pause it. These batteries have lasted much longer then the typical energizer batteries i have used for this class.",1
I bought this for my mom. The type is adjustable and it has a backlight for easy reading !,1
My Goddaughter love playing games on my tablet and watching her shows. Not we can load her favorite books and shows on her on tablet.,1
"I have always bought nabi's they have lasted for a couple of years with my grandkids This item I bought for my six year old grandson as an upgrade (his nabi lasted 26 months) This broke in two days after giving it to him, It would not charge and the LCD went out . I am now having to jump through hoops to get it replaced .",-1
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack). We subscribed to this. The batteries are holding up just as good as any other. You can't beat the price either.,1
Good price and good product.,1
So far these batteries perform as well as any other alkaline battery that I have used. The cost even beats Duracell at Costco so I consider it a good deal.,1
This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.,1
"I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it.",1
I am a professional photographer and have these as backup for flash. kids steal them for their gaming.. they work and last the same as every name brand.,1
Great for the kids. Sometimes have issues with the charging mechanism.,1
great price. works great.,1
Good price for a lot of batteries.,1
No issues with the batteries,1
Nice!,1
These batteries were horrible. They died with a couple of days use. I figured since they were Amazon brand they would be good but I was mistaken. Sorry I would not recommend these to anybody.,-1
The device is so simple for kids. It is great. I love the case it's really protective.,1
Amazon brand batteries are very poor quality. Don't last more than 3 months in a remote control (which barely uses any power). This is shameful and stupid as it diminishes confidence in the Amazon brand name.,-1
it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features.i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price,1
They're batteries. Excellent price and they work well. Will purchase again,1
They work well.,1
I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job,1
My niece and nephew are going to love this! I got it for a great price too. What a nice Christmas present,1
"I love this tablet,I use it for school readings ,for my philosophy class , my Mac book is to delicate to take to school,but my fire tablet is perfect !",1
"Small and light weight, easy to read from in bright light conditions",1
This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.,1
"Perfect to hand out for halloween, the kids really appreciate them.",1
Great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi,1
"Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too.",-1
"I love these batteries. First they are priced cheaper than the name brands but offer the same performance. They come in no frustration packaging instead of the terrible clamshells that most batteries from the store do. The cardboard box offers a handy place to store them in without being cut by the plastic or having them fall out of the pack. Each four batteries is individually sealed so you can place them in odd drawers throughout the house close to the items they will be powering. Finally I can have all the different size high performing batteries I may need without breaking the bank. You won't be disappointed with these.Please check Yes if you have found this review helpful. I rely upon others' reviews to make an informed decision anytime I make a purchase, so it is my intention to help others do the same. I welcome any questions or feedback.",1
"I get as good or better performance with these batteries as I do with any name brand batteries, but these are far less expensive, even compared to bulk packages in stores. I use a lot of batteries, so these were a great find! I love that the batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of four, thus making it easy to carry back-up batteries on-the-go. I have purchased these multiple times and will purchase again.",1
"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help.",0
Great price.,1
packed in 4.,1
Work fine. These are really nice and they are cheap.,1
"Great product for a great price, you can't go wrong with amazon! I love it!",1
Great price. Good quality,1
Product seems to be as advertised.,1
This is a great product at a great price I would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc.,1
if you use it for certain things it's great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can't be downloaded or found in the appstore,1
I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps,1
"My kids watch movies in the car, I link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. I have set up hulu / netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. Amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. And worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!!!!!",1
"Very nice packaging! Love the price and the nice convenient packaging makes it easy to store, find and keep track of the batteries. Great job Amazon!",1
"Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though",1
"Great for my one year old baby,he loves to play games and watch movies..",1
"works great, easy to read, portable, great value for the money",1
"Very impressed with this batteries, I am an energizer consumer and had been for years before descovering amazon basics",1
"I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great.",1
This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on!,1
Like it better then the nabi jr. More like a real tablet. Actually it is with the extra protective case,1
long lasting/good price,1
My daughter loves her kindle. I swapped out the case for one with a handle so she can carry it but it's perfect for her,1
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books.,1
What impressed me the most was the amount of free kids apps that you get with the Kindle. These are easy to use in both size and software.,1
As good of quality as any national brand. AmazonBasics always comes through.,1
"Considering that Duracell batteries are guaranteed to leak and ruin your device, these are an excellent alternative.",1
Well pleased with this upgrade purchase for husband! He loved his Fire 7 & loves his Fire HD 8 even more!,1
great dael,1
tested these batteries along side name brand in a handheld microphone and they actually preformed better and lasted longer then the big name brands.,1
This is a great value.,1
Work just as good as the name brands.,1
"Really nice tablet , screen is pretty clear. Useful apps is reason I bought it.",1
Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.,1
"Purchased for my grandson, he loves it. Purchased a blue cover for him",1
Bought it for my wife to replace older tablet. She loves it.,1
"We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life.",-1
"I love these batteries. I haven't tested them side by side, but I do not feel like I am changing them anymore frequently than the duracell we used to use, and these are less expensive.",1
I Received the Item in a Prompt Time and as Described.,1
"Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music.",1
"I purchased one of these for myself back in January, and when my mother remarked on it, I knew she wanted one as well. It works great for both myself and her, despite the differences in our reading habits and hand sizes.",1
"There isn't much I can say about these batteries. They are stand AA batteries that offer amazing performance at an amazing price! At 0.34 (normally 0.43) cents a battery, not only are they comparable to 1 batteries (Usually 0.25-0.50 cents a battery), but they are much more heavyweight and they last a lot longer! Between the 4 of us, especially our 2 kids, we fly through batteries like water and when we find a discount brand we like, we hold on to them tightly! I will be purchasing more AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries especially with the Holidays coming. They are inexpensive, high quality and worth every penny!",1
"Using this with my Samsung Galaxy Note. Overall works fine, even though I'm on Gingerbread and not 3.0. Slim and lightweight. Pairs instantly. Some specialty keys don't work, but I'm not concerned as its purpose is just to get in text. This keyboard is much faster than the on-screen keyboard for inputting text.However, Amazon does not sell a case for this keyboard. This is a perfect travel keyboard, but carrying it bare in my day bag concerned me. I did a LOT of searching for some kind of generic slip case that would fit. Nothing.Then I stumbled on the Domke protective wrap, which is just a square of padded material with Velcro at the corners. It's designed for wrapping cameras and lenses. The 11 square fit the keyboard perfectly. I took it down to a local tailor shop and for 3 they sewed up the long side of the square when folded over on itself and one of the short sides creating a slip case. The protective wrap has a soft felt-like side and a nylon side. I folded it with the soft side on the inside. Now I have a perfect slip case for the keyboard, and for just about 15 (12 for the wrap from Amazon and 3 for the sewing).",1
"Not a good tablet for kids. To avoid ads from appearing, you must pay 15 dollars.",-1
I purchased two for my grandchildren. They carry the Kindle with them everywhere they go. Great purchase!,1
"I found these batteries great, shipped on time, as advertized, good expiration dates, well packaged. I am puzzled by Amazon's refusing to ship more while investing what it claims are reports of problems. The reviews show overwhelmingly postive responses with 5 negative. I see Amazon happily offering many products with far worse stats. What is the story here When will the 'investigation' be over (Should the FBI be called in ) )",1
it was a good buy for when the had them on sale. I use it as my travel tablet,1
"Grand child loves it, before she had to look at her favorite movies. On the computer monitor,Now she can look at her movies anywhere.",1
"Not sure why I purchased so many batteries, but it is a wonderful feeling knowing that I have so many if needed.",1
As advised. Came really fast,1
Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!,1
Good Item,1
This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be.,1
I am so glad i procrastinated in buying an e-reader.I was going to get the kindle paperwhite- then the Voyage came out- I bought it and am so happy with it- a joy to use.,1
This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.,-1
"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint.",-1
So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.,1
This tablet is the best for kids. Switching from kids to adult is awesome! Works perfect and has lots and lots of apps for kids,1
Batteries that work :),1
I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.,1
I love these batteries from Amazon. I plan on stock piling my battery stock with all Amazon batteries. I am truly impressed on the packaging alone! Quality all the way! Great job Amazon!,1
"Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast.",1
At first I was a little skeptical about getting these batteries but after reading some of the reviews I decided to take a chance and try them for myself. The results....These batteries are on the money!! I would definitely recommend them to family and friends.,1
What else can you say about batteries for a quarter a piece,1
Great to use for my little one. She loves it awesome,1
Nothing too special or complicated. Fills the need.,0
Bought this for my sister. This has replaced her I Pad. She loves it.,1
Good price. Only used a few so far but what we used seems to last.,1
"Use these in a wireless BT mouse. Has about 30 less life as copper top brand. Good price, but most likely will not buy again.",-1
"The Tap is a fun way to be able to bring Alexa around your home. Where ever you are, you can get access to all of the information, music, news, radio and more!",1
I buy Amazon batteries regularly for price and product reliability and never had a problem.,1
"Basic, alkaline battery, highly rate by CU",1
"These are very nice and very high quality batteries. Batteries are not the most exciting thing in the world - until they die and you don't have any more! I would also like to mention (off topic, sorry) that I had a shipment of these go missing and Amazon was wonderful about replacing them.I will definitely get these again.",1
Great batteries and the price is right!,1
"Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible",-1
These seem comparable to most battery brands.,1
IT was just as described. I would recommend it to a friend.,1
Batteries work great and are such a good value.,1
love kindles and this one is the best one made by amazon. but expensive.,1
"Replaced Kobo EReader with this tablet, very satisfied with performance and price.",1
"I was a bit hesitant to order these because, you know, low priced batteries. But guess what Good quality batteries at a low price. What more could you ask These are as good or better than Duracell for less money.Well, go ahead and get them! You KNOW you'll need them.Go ahead.",1
"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.",1
This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling.,1
These are great! work just as good as the expensive name brand,1
its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it,1
My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.,-1
"Love this candle. When lights are turned out, it truly looks like a real candle. I bought 2 more and will probably get a few more for Christmas gifts.",1
BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.,1
First time purchase. I have just started using them. Seem to be a quality product. I will have to see how long they last.,1
"It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend.",1
Works great. Easy to use. Fast. Great for the whole family.,1
"Performance could be better, but for the price, these are hard to beat.",1
"Great product, good price",1
Wonderful batteries! These batteries are great and last a long time.,1
Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!,1
"I don't know if these last any longer or shorter than other brands, but the price is good so we'll see how it goes over time.",1
Work.,1
Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.,1
Purchashed this tablet for my son as a Christmas gift and he loves. Amazing features and very entertaining for a child,1
"My 5 year old son loves his kindle. He can fully work it himself. We love all the he age appropriate games, learning apps, and books. The case is great for all those accidentally drops.",1
they seem to have a very short life span. do not think i would buy again.,0
yay power.,1
I updated my credit car d more than six weeks ago. I won't bother you in the future.,-1
"I bought this at a discount, I don‚Äôt think it is well worth the price. Very compact and light",1
"I was disappointed, they do not last but a few days.",-1
"great quality, price and convenient to have available at all times",1
It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.,0
Extremely satisfied with the value and performance of the Fire kids edition; highly recommend for age 5 and up.,1
arrived timely and seem to be good,1
I purchase two of these backpacks for my wife and son's laptops. The case is well constructed and has many compartments. Its a great backpack for the price.,1
"I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it",0
"Best battery deal out there, And they work just as good as the name brands like Duracell.",1
"impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate",1
"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !",-1
good deal,1
Super good deal!,1
"Easy for reading, easy to hold - can send emails, takes pictures - must be connected to WIFI to get setup.",1
Worst batteries I've ever bought. Last about two weeks in a remote control.,-1
LOVED THE BATTERIES. VERY GOOD,1
The tablet is wonderful the only negative about this tablet is that it doesnt allow you to download kids youtube or any google app that im aware of.... i almost returned the tablet but i found a website that showed me how to turn off security settings and download the links i needed in order to get the app so now everything is great and we love it!,1
"Bought as Christmas gift. She loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty.",1
Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages.,1
"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad.",1
I bought two tablets for you little ones and they love them. I would recommend.,1
Great value and price... Will be purchasing this again and recommending to others!!!,1
"This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too.",1
We really enjoy our Alexa. I always have it for music. Lately we been movie times. The kids like to ask it silly questions and they can't get enough of it,1
Great price and they last just as well as the name brand. Will buy again as needed.,1
"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",0
Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.,1
Good inexpensive device. Still in touch with modern technology.,1
Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.,1
These are every bit as good as the big name brands for a fraction of the price. I have found my new go to battery brand!!!,1
"Large package, good price. Work as expected.",1
Went with the portable unit for travel. Easy access and portability.,1
They die quickly,-1
"these were under a light we thought they were there to fit the light when they arrived and nice company they were not the batteries we needed it should have been aa but that is ok,it was our fault not knowing this. thanks..",0
"Great product, fast shipping with PRIME, and AWESOME PRICE!!!",1
I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who lives in another state. He loves it and plays with it all the time. My son tells me the games on it are mostly educational and really seem to be helpful. Excellent little device to this time.,1
Bought as birthday present for grandson and he plays with it daily and with the case on it he hasn't broken it either.,1
"Amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery. I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leaks. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaked while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitored One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packaging, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tab to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package.",-1
"I have bought these Amazon batteries a few times. It is just so convenient. And you might as well just keep batteries stocked and by this big one. Especially around the holidays. There is nothing more painful than when you 8 year old gets something new and you have to search the house for some other device that contains AA batteries. Just buy these. And when you run out, order them again. Why stress yourself out over running to the store for AA batteries when your child is screaming and crying over their remote control car. These last a long time as far as I can tell. I have rarely replaced them so far.",1
These batteries are a great value.,1
Thanks,1
It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget,0
Works great. Easy to set time limits and goals. Easy to set up multiple profiles. Excellent product. As advertised.,1
work great,1
Great batteries,1
Great value,1
"Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far!",1
Good Deal Works Great.,1
"Was considering a Kindle but decided to get the 8"" fire table to get some Android apps, Internet and a larger screen for reading.The experience had been descent and battery life enough to use all day.",1
They do not work. I had to buy Duracell,-1
These go dead very quickly. Not worth it if you rely on whatever the batteries are powering. Maybe ok for a remote control or something unimportant.,-1
Seem to work as good as Energizers I have been using.,1
"Works great, good price. Would buy it again. Kids have great time with it.",1
"Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos.",1
"I bought this for several reasons, the 2 year warranty, ease of use. My granddaughter is 21 months old and she has figured it out. Very durable, she drops it and it keeps on working",1
"I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied.",1
I love this Fire for kids. It even comes with the bumper cover. Great buy.,1
No complaints.,1
Great selections. Hard to find assistance at times.,1
"The kindle fire kids is perfect size for our toddler, case is super durable, and I love how it can set up age appropriate as our child grows",1
Very good product. No issues. Great price.,1
A bunch of triple A batteries at a great price. I don't go to anyone anymore for batteries or chargers except amazon basics. There really is no need to pay more for batteries than the cheapest price. I would not be surprised if these are re branded batteries of some major manufacturer. Either way they perform up to par with other name brand batteries.,1
This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.,1
Can't complain. They seem fully comparable to name brand AA batteries.,1
Great first tab for game playing and basic web surfing. Enough speed to navigate the web and for multiwindow tasking.,1
I didn't want to buy my 8 year old something really expensive but I wanted a good device so I tried this out and she loves it. The case that comes with it makes it almost indestructible.,1
"Thanks, Amazon! I love the convenience of ordering batteries online and at a great rate. We put them into a battery organizer we have which is in our junk drawer (which is not junky thanks to the organizer). The batteries work well as far as we can tell, and it's great to get them at a low cost with free shipping.",1
More battery than other batteries,1
Seem to last. Can't beat price point.,1
"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top brands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top brands in the future. We go through a lot of the AA variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but...",0
Nice cheap battery. Will not last as long as a regular brand battery. You can even feel the difference,-1
Always happy with Amazon and these didn't disappoint. Work great and great price!!,1
works as you would think..grat price,1
Great deal for long lasting batteries.,1
Plain old good batteries,1
"At first, i was not sure and going to get the name brand batteries, Then i was like, let me just give them a try, its made by Amazon so i must be good. When i got them i was very happy because they are Great batteries. Last very long time, the big plus is the price . You get a great product for a low price.",1
Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class,1
"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic.",1
great batteries,1
Great performance!,1
Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened .,1
"They worked great and last ad long as or longer than the name brands e.g. (Duracell, Energizer)",1
This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.,0
It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use.,1
"I bought a big pack of the AAA batteries, but really didn't put them through the test until Hurricane Matthew. They worked awesome. Never had to change batteries in the lanterns after 5 days of heavy use (8-9 hours a day). Worked great in my son's toys, our remote controls, just everything. I know what brand I will buy from now on! Great job Amazon.",1
Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size.,1
It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.,-1
"These batteries are better than name brand. When used in a device that has consistent, and equal, daily use, these batteries lasted 2 days longer than the bunny and the copper top.",1
"Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words.",1
This is a great tablet. Great for the price. Very fast and easy to use.,1
"I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it.",1
"Bought 3 for my young grandkids exceptional security for kids, great babysitter as well as educational tool",1
Batteries!,1
I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.,1
"these are the only AA batteries i buy now, great price and outlasts any of the batteries from the big box stores",1
"after downloading the Nook app, I now have both a kindle reader and Nook reader in the same device",1
They're batteries and they're cheap. Cheaper than the store brand. I am content!,1
"Nothing wrong with these batteries. They seem to work just as good as the named brand ones I buy at the store and they defiantly work better than the cheap-o ones. I am currently using some in a battery operated lanterns, a flash light, and one of my youngest daughters toy. I have not experienced any problems with these.I really like that I can order good quality batteries at a good price and have them delivered to my door. Honestly we could always use more batteries at our house.",1
Does the job!,1
My kid loves the tablet. She is learning so much with the apps.,1
"Great price, great product",1
No issues whatsoever. Works well! Best e reader there is!,1
The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is a great device for kids and parents to entertain kids during long or short trips,1
I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much,1
is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better,0
They seem to last as long as name brand batteries.,1
We bought it on a bunch and we're very pleased with the ease of use and the way our granddaughter was motivated to use it.,1
Good value for the price and for the children. The apps are enough to let them play and read.,1
excellent,1
Great deal great product!,1
Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.,1
"They don't last as Duracell or Energizer. For the price, it's a good buy.",1
I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it and now thinks its great since she has her own computer she says.,1
Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading...,1
"My daughter love her tablet. And is easy to use, and the battery last longer..",1
I like it,1
Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games.,1
Gave it as a gift to my mom for Christmas. She‚Äôs not into new tech. But after three weeks she loves it!,1
Bought this to use with my kindle voyage and I love it. It charges my Kindle in 3 hours or less sometimes and the battery lasts for weeks.,1
Cheap,1
Gave this to my son who breaks everything and so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content.,1
This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts.,1
My son's love there tablet. Great but for the price,1
Great Quality ...Excellant Price,1
I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display,1
The package is A LOT smaller than I thought. That'snice.,1
Thanks for delivering on-time because I had to get it fast.,1
"Easy to figure out and I like the paperwhite because it doesn‚Äôt strain your eyes and you can adjust the size of the font. Bought one for my mom too and she loves it. The only con is the touch sensitivity could be better, but not bad for $60 on sale",1
Bought it for my daughter and she can't put it down. Great for nextflix,1
great buy for the money.,1
item arrived on time and was as advertised,1
I bought two of these tablets for both of my kids. They love it!,1
"I love the parental controls available. You can set what time they can start and stop using, as well as how much time on each activity. Also love the guarantee of replacement.",1
Satisfactory and arrived promptly.,1
They seem to work well and with a 10 year shelf life why buy in two and 4 packs when you can save money like this.,1
Would highly recommend to anyone with children. Great value for money,1
Great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go. Love that this stream and plays Prime music. Battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best.,1
Great tablet for simple tasks. I bought 2 and I have no complaints.,1
They are batteries!,1
"These batteries worked just fine and unlike the last Energizer batteries, they didn't leak. I'll never buy Energizer again.",1
Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.,1
"Bought this for my mom who is 93 and her other Fire deceased. It was very easy for me to set up for her and transfer over her account information. She has really enjoyed using it and has even started using some new apps. Due to her age and my not living closer, it would be nice to be able to have a print copy of how to do things. Otherwise it is surprisingly easy for her to use.",1
"These batteries last as long as many of the name brands. They are packaged in sets of 4 in a sturdy box, and the individual packages are easy to open. No complaints in regards to price and longevity of use as I'm getting the same amount of use out of things like my battery operated mouse as I would with a name brand.",1
I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.,1
"Work great, at a fraction of the price of normal batteries!",1
I've finally found a tablet that fits the needs of my granddaughter.,1
"this was an ouststanding deal. I bought it through Alexa voice order. since I didn't get the Alexa price for some reason, I contacted amazon customer service and Amazon corrected the problem quickly, without more information and effort on my part. I *love* that about amazon.the batteries were in a plain box, wrapped in four packs. I often buy amazonbasics, both for the quality and the simple, clean packaging. I use a lot of aa batteries in items that do not work with my rechargeables. I don't mind finding space for 48. in fact the box of 48 requires just a little more space than a 20-24 pack of other batteries since other batteries use more packaging.put these in your wish list or save for later in your cart and watch for a great price to buy them.",1
Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily,1
Love it! Brought it for a gift for myself.. I'm really enjoying it! Great price too!,1
great deal,1
"Love the Tap! Bought it as a gift and love the sound quality. For such a small speaker, it packs a big punch!",1
"These are great batteries, at a great deal. They last a long time and we are very happy with the purchase. We did however have some that are DOA, I called Amazon and they took care of us, AWESOME customer service, as always.",1
i would buy this item again. however charging port is,1
Chose this over a regular Bluetooth speaker and am so glad I did. Alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done. The sound quality is great. I've used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam.,1
This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect.,1
"Nice product, great price and expandable storage unlike the HD version",1
"Granddaughter loves it, easy for a toddler to hold and maneuver.",1
Only batteries I use now...,1
"I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books....",1
"Maybe mine is a bad batch, had a serious leak on one of them, these batteries seem to last as long as duracells but duracells never leaked in my experience",-1
"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far.",1
Not really impressed by this item. It is pretty slow.,-1
"I've enjoyed the original Kindle (with keyboard) for many years, and it was finally time to upgrade. The light is great, and I use the page press buttons exclusively. Very happy with the size, weight, and appearance of this product.",1
Great quality! Last as long as any of the big brands.,1
"I have an echo, tap and a dot. Currently my tap serves as a Bluetooth speaker for my dot - making it more like the echo, but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere. It has really good sound much like my echo. It also works great in the app and syncs with all my other products.",1
Great product. High quality. Recommend.,1
I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!,1
Needed a tablet for games and apps for the elderly. Great choice,1
Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it,0
"After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use.",1
Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.,1
They are batteries. They work. Don't know what else to say. Except they were ridiculously cheap!!,1
My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.,1
My child loves this device. She doesn't stop playing with it.,1
I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.,0
just what one would expect. working batteries.,1
Plenty of power for your average household ham and egger.,1
"Best value tablet for the little ones. Great warranty, great parental controls. It's a shame Apple hasn't caught on to the needs of parents when it comes to digital media.",1
"This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations.",1
"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long.",-1
"great product to use , easy to setup and use.. with all amazon options",1
You can't go wrong with this Amazon Fire tablet for $50.,1
Long lasting,1
Quality product at a reasonable cost. Travels anywhere.,1
Great value.,1
Great tablet for the kids as it includes some good educational apps and has a good case that surrounds it for durability.,1
i have bought the AA 48 packs twice now and they are terrible... They don't even last a month...,-1
easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS,1
Great item fOr a great price!,1
"For the price, it is quite a nice tablet. I must admit there's little I've done with it for now, the goal being to get it to the kids to control their Lego Boost kit with it.",1
"These are my new go to for batteries. Last holiday season I used these batteries in half of our window candles and Duracell it the other half. Basically no difference in battery life and the price can't be beat. If anything, the candles with these batteries lasted longer.",1
the product is working perfectly and the service was greatThank you,1
Good,1
Great deal for AAs. Batteries seem to last as long as most other brands.,1
This tablet has great storage capacity. I have downloaded all kinds of children's movies and learning activities. It's great.,1
Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games.,1
Great tablet for kids they love it it is also great that you can download music and movies through Amazon Prime,1
Bought this for my step sons. They positively love it and it is so easy to navigate. The only draw back is with the capability for them to download games the memory is close to full,1
"Great quality, it takes very longer until the battery drain itself. I highly reccomend this amazon basic battery. And i love to get and buy more.",1
"Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward.",1
Git this for my son who had already broke his 1st tablet. I got this for about half the price of his first one and it is much better quality than the 1st one. Thinking about getting another one for his brother.,1
Excellent product and price.,1
"This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device.",1
Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage.,1
GREAT PRICE.,1
My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy,1
"The Amazon Fire is excellent small compact, got it for my daughter's Christmas, she loves it. My daughter bought one for her grandfather which is 83 years old, he's doing good with it easy to use.",1
"Super deal, and work great.",1
Works like a standard alkaline battery.,1
He loves electronics around Christmas so this was right up his alley! He loves telling Alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs,1
"purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!!",1
"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets.",1
So far it begin good for my 4yrs old toddler. She enjoy every minute of it.The parental control it's a plus. It also allow you to make multiple kid and adults profiles without any problems issues.,1
I didn't actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles.,1
"Same features as Echo now, but easier to move around the house as needed w/you.",1
Excellent kids tablet good for reading and videos. Very easy to set up.,1
These batteries are really long lasting. I use them for my Xbox one and I haven't had to change one pair yet. It does the job well,1
This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for.,1
These are great batteries for the price! I use them for my Xbox controllers. I game a lot and I use 2 batteries a week or so.,1
I can lock the screen so he can't mess anything up while I'm playing him an educational video plus built in case to handle and accidents this tab is golden,1
Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use.,1
Perfect thanks,1
Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.,1
Was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it,1
"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost.",1
Seem to perform well. Good price!,1
Very happy with purchase!,1
"When I heard one of the consumer gurus on the radio a few years ago saying that some of the generic or lesser known brands of batteries were often as good as the name brands, I tried a pack of the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries instead of the usual name brand. I've bought several packs since then, and although I haven't done any objective testing, they appear to be about as long-lasting and reliable as any other brands that I've tried. Some of the batteries were installed a couple of years ago, and they still have some charge, and there's been no leakage or corrosion. I've been very pleased with the AmazonBasics alkaline batteries.",1
You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.,0
I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.,0
"Works great with good storage but, lacks online browsing speed.",1
"I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics.",1
Great batteries!,1
"I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it",0
Bought if for my 6 year old son. Has plenty of space. Long battery life. It's durable and hasn't broke when dropped (I'm going to buy a case though!!!),1
"Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much.",1
I would recommend this anytime as it's a great product it's,1
"Bought as Christmas gift. He loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty.",1
"This is my third Kindle and by far the best. I know use this for 100% of all reading - including - and the reason I bought it, for reading in the pool. I still own 2 good tablets and a laptop. This does not compete with them. Absolutely outstanding outside in Dallas. This does not overheat, with absolutely zero glare. Yes I can read in the pool on a sunny day. I have about 300 books on this and don't charge it but once every other week. I use it 1-3 hours a day without fail. I wish the unit was truly water resistant and it's built in browser is almost worthless. This is an eReader and not a tablet.",1
Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.,1
"Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc",1
"This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet.",1
Great product would recommend it this to others. Have a great picture.,1
I didn't find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games.,-1
I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it,1
My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.,1
"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price.",0
Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.,1
No complaints,1
"my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger",1
I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.,1
I feel like they don't work as long.,0
Great for my four year old. She is able to access all her learning games with ease.,1
Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket,1
Easy and simple for my grandson to use. Has no problem using it.,1
Bought this for my childs toy and what a great price!,1
"easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load",1
DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries!,-1
"Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets.",1
You can't beat the price! Lasts as long if not longer than national brands! This is my second order!,1
i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe,1
good,1
"Is it just me, or is it a huge challenge keeping enough batteries on hand. It's easy just to order a bulk box of these rather than take a beating at retail price. I'm not sure they are up to Energizer or Duracell standards, but they do the job ok. No complaints so far.",1
good price,1
I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation.,1
"I bought this device recently for my daughter, she likes it very much. She learning new things. I also gifted this device to my friends Son.",1
great table for kids and parents control great gre,1
Mostly just use it for the speaker. Still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding.,1
"bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture.",-1
"Smaller then what i expecting, alexa sounds loud and clear. Music sounds great, just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button",1
"Portable, durable, strong battery life and it came with 13k in education programs. Both children are proud and showing do much responsibility by taking care of there tablet. They have designed their own schedule. Am very happy for them both. Best investment ever.",1
Same for these AA batteries as for the AAA batteries.,1
"So far, so good. I like how Amazon provides reliable basics that I can easily order through Prime and save myself a trip to the store.",1
My child loves her tablet and I love it. It keeps her busy with learning games and books,1
He loves his kindle takes it everywhere. does school work on it plus plays games Excellent piece of equipment.,1
terrific,1
Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.,1
"I love AmazonBasics items. For anything they offer, that's what I check for first before looking at any other brands. This is our second order of these batteries and we have them in a couple other sizes as well. They perform as well as the more expensive brands and last just as long. I will definitely be buying them again.",1
"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly.",1
This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn't charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device,1
Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.,1
"Overall it's okay, I don't like that it takes forever to charge.",1
Great product with quick delivery.,1
"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-",1
"Bye bye big name, expensive batteries!! Holy moly! I never knew that Amazon sold batteries. In all the years I've been shopping here! I came across these while searching for batteries to use with my son's toys (they all take a ton) as well as for use in products around the house. I took a look at the reviews and decided they were definitely worth trying out! Of course I used my Prime shipping and they arrived in 2 days. Once they arrived we put 3 in my son's toy train and BAM! off it took with speed! Even my son said wow, the train is going faster than ever haha! I'm currently using these in his toys, the wall clock, the meat thermometer and many other items! I certainly recommend these batteries. They came packaged nicely in groups of 4, tucked into a cute little cardboard box. At a fraction of the cost of the big name batteries and they work JUST AS WELL if not BETTER!",1
"Don't last quite as long as name brand, but worth the money.",1
We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.,1
Fast inexpensive tablet. Great deal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
This was for my sister birthday. She really like it a lot.,1
"Nice batteries, without the famous name brands or high price...",1
This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood,1
Great to have a good supply of batteries that come in a good storage case.,1
"I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it.",1
"This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere.",1
just what i needed,1
"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!",1
I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality.,1
"Works perfect, came in new conditions.",1
A lot of batteries for the good price. But they don't last too long.,0
This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.,1
"My 4 year old loves it. Easy to function and pretty tough, it has been dropped a few times and did not crack or break.",1
Bought 15 for a town wide holiday party. Versatile tablet that is easy to use and allows access to everything important to a teenager,1
"I love that Amazon offers its own brand of products for an amazing price! These batteries work just as well as any other brand I've purchased from the store, if not better. I have a remote control that eats through batteries (it also powers headphones so I don't disturb my boyfriend while he's trying to sleep) and so far these have lasted longer than the Duracell batteries I've been using. They were a better deal as well! I've already recommended these to my family and friends with children who always complain that all their kids toys requires batteries. I will be buying more!",1
This product is a perfect learning tool for my daughter,1
It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.,1
Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.,1
great,1
"great price, I look forward to using these and seeing how long they last. will update when known. Packages very well",1
Overall very good product for kid. Much robust and easy to operate.Only downside is that it is sometimes very slow.,1
I really like not having the bump on the bottom like the previous Kindle reader like the previous Kindle readerI dislike the fact that the screen is not recessed like the previous Kindle reader so that you cannot set the unit down facedown,1
"I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience.",1
Great product! I will recommend this to all of my family and friends.,1
Excellent product,1
"I put two of these batteries in my wireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out. I will throw the rest of them away and NEVER buy these again.I know I'll never get my money back. I'll just write it off as a lesson learned.",-1
Coming from a nook reader. Love the even backlighting and weight.,1
"GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE",1
i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime,1
Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.,1
"So far the 1yo loves it. I thought it would be too much, but no.",1
Batteries seem to last a long time at a great price.,1
i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.,1
useful,1
I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do,1
KIDS LOVE THEM. THEY ARE VERY DURABLE. VERY USER FRIENDLY.,1
"purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it.",1
"Perfectly respectable battery.I have been using Duracell batteries almost exclusively since I first went to sea in the 1970s. No complaints then. Still no complaints.I bought some of these AmazonBasics batteries just to try them out. Nothing scientific--other reviewers have done that well enough.Basically I'm satisfied. When I'm at sea I'll probably stick with Duracells, but these Amazon Basics are getting the job done at home.",1
Batteries can be so expensive when you are purchasing small quantities. This AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries 20-Pack was a great bargain that puts the batteries at 0.33 cents each or less. They work well.,1
"Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks.",1
Amazing quantity of durable batteries at excellent price.,1
Awesome product I would recommend this to anyone.,1
Has everything you will ever need inside. For children and adultsA+++,1
Great price for great batteries.,1
"Context: Replacement for my old Nexus 7; bought during black friday/cyber monday sale.Pros:-Literally the only decent android tablet for its price.-Good battery life.Cons:-No access to google play apps/services (youtube, gmail, etc only via browser).-First one I purchased had a defective speaker - QC might be variable.Thoughts:Amazon's insistence on using their own app store/android version is annoying, as is the subsequent lack of core google apps. However, for the price there is very little competition among android tablets.",0
This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.,0
"Got this to replace my iPhone that my daughter constantly has to have to watch her Elmo videos. This is a durable perfect solution. She understands most of the apps and can navigate to watch whatever she wants. This comes with a warranty that if she does anything to break it, it will be replaced for free. That was the final selling point I needed!",1
"Bought for my daughter. Has everything she needs, great value",1
I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It's way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven't had any problems with it. Well worth your money,1
"Second time ordering these and it probably wont be the last. Very impressed with the run time and the price is right (especially if you are a Prime member.) It's been proven to me over many years both by my own research and feedback from customers that when it comes to branded alkaline batteries the differences between Energerzier, Duracell, Radio Shack, Panasonic Ray-O-Vac and Amazon are so negligible as to make price the real deciding factor",1
"Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis.",1
Great buy for my 7yr old cheap so if it ends up broken for any reason I can replace it easily.,1
I'm feeling like these are running out of performance faster than other batteries I've purchased.,-1
Purchased at a decent price and haven't noticed any difference from any other batteries I have used. Long as you can get them at a decent price I'd definitely recommend.,1
They're batteries and work. That's what is important.,1
"this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch..",1
"I've bought these before. They used to have a different design, but with the new design comes longer life! I love these, especially for the price. Definitely last as long as the name brands!",1
This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices,1
"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her.",1
High performance batteries.,1
Not all that long life.,0
The package just arrived and all seems well. I have no information on the life of these batteries. If they do well I would be glad to give them 5 stars.,1
"My 3 year old destroyed an iPad mini. This thing has held up through drops, throws , and sticky fingers. Awesome investment for road trips.",1
Bought this for a family member to get her school books on as well as entertainment. She loved it and didn't put it down.,1
Good deal on AAA alkaline batteries.,1
Love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what I needed it for great price,1
Grandkids fight over this. My daughter also uses this. Very good and user friendly. Would buy again.,1
Great value!,1
"Fantastic bargain and holding up well months later. I go through a lot of batteries, like almost everyone nowadays. So I searched for a better deal. I think I found it here. A big savings over grocery store batteries.",1
this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...,1
Excellent,1
"There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding.",1
"I got these to use in my classroom for various things, so far there is no difference between these and the duracell i was buying. Tons of batteries for a great price.",1
Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.,1
seems to last as long as other batteries.,1
I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.,1
"The extra money for the Voyage version is well worth it, as the screen is brighter, clearer, and easier on the eyes. The other specs are also nicer compared to other Kindle versions, but the screen is what sold me.",1
Great packaging - nice little card board box to store the batteries in. Beats the packs batteries usually come in.,1
"I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! I love the user friendly parental controls!",1
This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips,1
"Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps.",1
"Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways",1
This Alexa is a super form of info with little wait time.,1
Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them.,1
"I bought this Amazon Fire HD 8 purely for personal travel use because I dont like to bring my laptop in case if I lose my laptop! This Amazon Fire is cheap enough that if I lose it during personal travel, I don't care & I will just buy another one. This is my first Amazon Fire. So far, I am happy because the screen is big enough during internet surfing that I can see a whole lot better than my 4"" cell phone. If I could ""re-do"" my purchase, I should have purchased the Amazon Fire 7. Both Fire 7 & HD 8 fit in my side pants' pocket, but HD 8 is a bit bigger & thus heavier. When I looked at both Fire 7 & HD 8 in the Best Buy store, they were not connected to wi-fi. So I purchased HD 8. And, I will keep HD 8. I dont think it would be right for me to return it to BB to exchange for 7 because I already opened the package. Overall, I am happy with Fire HD 8.",1
It's always nice to have batteries on hand and these last. Great value!,1
"I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it's place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it.",1
If you have kids you will love this product. It's very easy to use.,1
Work,1
Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating,-1
Great,1
Arrived yesterday as promised! Little one loves it,1
"Very happy with this ""basic"" ereader. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a ""paperwhite""), and form factor is comfortable. Special offers (ads) are totally non-invasive and I hardly notice anything; especially since I use the reader with wifi turned off. Sometimes I wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where I feel I'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem.",1
This is a great tablet plus you can't beat this price.,1
Bought this for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it good learning tool along with great fun for him!,1
I can plow through a lot of batteries because I camp a lot. These batteries power and last just as long as the more expensive ones at the big box stores.,1
I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it.,1
Quality and price cant be beat!,1
Great value.,1
we're early in the stages of home smartness but this is a good start,1
This is everything the echo is but portable. You're not getting the same sound quality but more than enough for the backyard or beach. A recent update was made to give you the option of using the button or voice activated controls.,1
This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.,1
"The new design is lighter, has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear. The light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent. The new Kindle Voyage is amazing!",1
A great money saving alternative to the ipad for my son who likes ti play games and read books.,1
"This is the fourth one of these that I have purchased. My grand children love them. Between the one year of programming and the two years of warranty, I don't think there is a better tablet on the market for children. Excellent product and it works very well with the children at what ever level they are at.",1
"No problem with these batteries. They get used in various remotes, USB devices and other low-wattage draw items, so it is hard to say how well they will last. However, I have not had an issue to date. Will buy again.",1
I buy amazonbasics batteries in all the sizes that they make. they're great.,1
"As advertised, works fine. Fast shipping. Have bought before and will but again.",1
"Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids,",1
"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book.",1
"All 20 of the batteries are dead (no power). Very disappointed to receive a product with Amazon's name on it that is useless, especially as a Prime member.",-1
These are excellent batteries and the price is right.,1
I just wanted to comment that I feel the individual 4-pack packaging is unnecessary. I personally don't have anything that takes four batteries. Several twos and a lot of threes. I'd prefer a box full of loose batteries rather than having to search around for a knife to cut free what I need.,1
My 4 year old love to watch movies and this is perfect for him!,1
They're batteries. They work and are cheaply priced.,1
"20 batteries for 8 bucks is cheap. You won't find that even at Costco. Hopefully, they will last.",1
My daughter loves her tablet! She's only two and has learned how to use and navigate with ease.,1
"should have bought the bigger pack, used most of these up already, forgot how much stuff I had that uses AAA batteries.",1
These batteries work as well as any batteries I've purchased for the things I need batteries in. We have these shipped automatically using Subscribe and Save and I it is nice to ALWAYS have batteries on hand!,1
I need the Geek Squad to help me with the Amazon Prime I purchased it for 2 granddaughters but I don't want them to have access to my books.,1
Seem to work as well as name brand batteries at a much better price,1
These are cheap and work as well as name brand batteries.,1
excellent price and I don't notice any difference in them from the more expensive ones at the store,1
These last the longest,1
"These batteries work. They don't last as long as I'd like but they do work fine. They came in frustration free packaging that I ended up needing scissors to open because they batteries come shrink wrapped in a little box and getting the plastic off of the batteries was NOT frustration free. So, three stars because they work but aren't great. I will probably not re-order these.",0
I am using it for my 3 year old and she loves it..,1
It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget,0
Love this!!!!It is kidproof...I have a active 1 year old grandson who enjoy it very much!!!,1
Best bang for your buck............................,1
These seem to be fresher and last longer then the name brands.,1
"Using my el cheapo multimeter (Fluke was at work) all batteries were well within the my device's tolerance for reading resting voltage and internal resistance. No duds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapper in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name brands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charger, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available.",1
I bought this for my son's 7th birthday and he loves it!,1
"Will purchase in bulk in the future. Great price,long-lasting batteries even in high demand electronics. Quality batteries. Makes me trust the Amazon brand more. I will buy other Amazon branded items with confidence now.",1
"this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range",1
"We have two Amazon Echo's and both work flawlessly!Easy to set up, great for all around use, constantly add new features.",1
Fun new product. Great gift idea especially if you aren't good with technology.,1
Good,1
Good value for Battery's.,1
Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it.,1
"Work just like any other high end batteries I have purchased in the past but at a great price. Will buy more of these in the future, for sure!",1
Git this for my son who had already broke his 1st tablet. I got this for about half the price of his first one and it is much better quality than the 1st one. Thinking about getting another one for his brother.,1
I wouldnt say they are worse or better then name brand batteries. about the same,0
great price,1
Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient,1
I love my amazon fire tablet. It's got great screen resolution and is very easy to use. It works for both adults and kids. I love the books and all the app options.,1
"Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year.",1
Great price and great performance. I loaded 10 of these batteries into my Field Camera 6 months ago and the camera is still taking pictures.,1
great,1
"not just for the kids, for the tablet challenged (me) I find it easy to work with",1
It is a great starter tablet for young kids. My son really enjoyed it.,1
My kids love this product it keeps them busy anytime of day,1
"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful",0
"They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long.",-1
My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter,1
I bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them.,1
A gift to my 2 year old granddaughter. It came preloaded with child programs. She quickly learned how to access the programs. Parents now have their iPad back...very well protected for tosses and drops,1
This is my first kindle or fire or even an ereader but I love it! I can't put it down!,1
Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music.,1
they work but I wish they were USA made,0
I've used 4 of these batteries now and the life appears to be comparable with that of Duracell/Energizer. The cost savings over the mainstream brands makes these a real winner! Would buy again.,1
A good buy if you spend more than 50.00 so you won't have to pay shipping.,1
"We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too.",1
Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.,1
"Everything you want in a tablet. Size is good, price is great.",1
Although not the greatest tablets on the market when compared to Apple or Samsung products but when you weight in the price it is worth the purchase!,1
"Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use.",1
These were a must with kids Christmas presents! Will be ordering again.,1
"My two year old learned how to operate my smart phone so I decided to get her a tablet. After looking at various toy and educational versions, this seemed like the best choice. The preloaded apps are fun and educational. The ability to set daily time limits is great as I didn't want this to becoming a replacement for playing outside or an instant babysitter. Also the ability to switch profiles and operate like any other kindle fire is nice for when my wife wants to read. Great deal with a good manufacturer warranty. Very pleased with it.",1
Batteries are batteries,1
"New source for batteries. I'll keep a box or two of these around the house from now on.Less packaging would be nice. A sealed box, then shrinkwrap.",1
"These have been a much improved highly accepted battery replacement for the last order of Orange boxed Pro-Cells we received.Duracells were so short lived, it was necessary to get them out of service due to unstable charge, and even seals leaking and ruining devices.Amazon Basics items have been a way to save money consistently, and get quality that some manufacturers are skimping on.These have been no exception.They are dated: 2026, and I have no doubt they are a great buy.As of now these are powering many devices, and none have shown any questionable service.",1
"It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating.",1
very good product in its price range affordable and very good,1
Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times,0
These are great. I used to have to go to Costco to get the equivalent number of batteries at a discount. Now I can get these batteries in a couple of days from Amazon.,1
Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung,0
"I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong.",1
Great price. Good Quality. No complaints.,1
"I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!",1
Blue is beautiful & allows grand-daughter to be able to tell which one is hers. Loves the piano program and challenging herself to play as much of the song as she can. Nice size for traveling with.,1
"Great batteries, very comparable to all the top name brands, but at a much better price!!",1
This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!,1
I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!,-1
"Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read",1
"Might be okay. But, they seem cheap. They have warm light (orangeish in color). They have the feeling that they might only last a year or too, and not multiple Christmas seasons. We are doing a timer test and have one that does not want to follow the standard timer. Also, the window suction cup things are to small for these candles. They will ultimately work, but are going to be stretched to do so. Picture is of the loan gunmen candle (screw the built of n timer!!!).",-1
This is a very good product my kids do homework on it,1
"These batteries are alot better than i thought they would be. I bought them thinking they would burn out quick, WRONG!!!!!! They have lasted longer than the batteries i was using before i bought these. I use them quite a bit in xbox controller and my kids remote control cars. Very good batteries and good quality for the price. I was very suprised!!!",1
Great !!!A lot of batteries.Last long and don't leak.,1
Good to have A batteries at such a good price,1
I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding,1
This was the perfect gift for a loved one. She was excited to receive it.,1
"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product.",-1
"Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service.....",1
I'm using three now and so far they're good. I love the flat sturdy box they came. Perfect for storing. Also a lot more batteries than I realized. :-),1
"I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this",1
ok,1
"This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there.",1
"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. I love that it has so much memory space, so I can download tons of games and activities to keep him occupied on long rides. I love the 2 year warranty and safety case. He loves it!",1
I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use,1
Get tired of running out of batteries. Hope these last a while. Good product,1
The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon,1
"this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it",1
Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank,1
"Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it.",1
The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects.,1
Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device.,1
It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use.,1
Love all the features that come with this speaker. Alexa function by tapping device is a nice change of pace from the always listening echo and dot! Above avarage sound on the go and got a great deal on it!,1
"Good product, great price. Big improvement over my first tablet.",1
I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date.,1
Batteries for my MP3 player it takes one I sleep with it every night and the battery lasted me two nights around 16 hours in total time,1
Gift was on point. Recipient was very pleased. Would recommend to others.,1
"Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier.",1
I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. great,1
This product does what it say it do. I really enjoy reading,1
Love it!! My two year old loves to watch Sesame Street & football,1
they work,0
"Lost my ""paper white"" in airplane, have to buy new one. Voyage is latest model, I like it. Friend of mine wants one as well with my recommendation, so, bought two. Nice to have them!",1
"3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose.",-1
So far so good. Still going. Time will tell. Good price,1
Good deal.,1
Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.,1
make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.,1
"Never knew that Amazon sold batteries until now. Stop buying those batteries at the grocery store and use these! I always run out of batteries in my wireless mouse and keyboard at the worst time because I ignore the low battery warnings. These batteries come in a small cardboard box about the size of 2 boxes of office pens. Inside, the batteries are wrapped in packs of 4 which keeps them neatly organized inside.Overall, these works extremely well and I will never buy batteries at the store again.",1
I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.,1
"Works as well as the Big brands, well worth the money",1
So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life.,1
"I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line. I also have down loaded books. I use it to take photos. It is small and be taken easily. I would recommend it to anyone .",1
It's works really well and don't have any issues at all,1
Great batteries at a great price!,1
"So far, these batteries are very good. I like to have a large quantity on hand so I don't have to always be buying a battery. The price was real good and I have nothing negative to say.",1
This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!,1
Easy to use at home or lunch at the office. The only problem I have is that you have to restart often. Great while using public transportation.,1
Low costs batteries that work great with good extended lifetime.,1
"I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for.",1
Good tablet for a 1 yr old. At first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip. Good product for the price,1
So far so good,1
Long Lasting,1
I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!,1
Works same as energizer batteries,1
I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price.,1
"they are batteries, they work",1
I bought this tablet to use with my 3 year old autistic son. I tried 3 different tablets and all 3 were defective. It would turn off by itself during a video. We were using It for his therapy sessions and this was very inconvient. Switched to a 7 and have had no trouble since.,0
"There is no better E-reader available today. It costs a bit more, but the build quality is the best.",1
Bought this for my 83-year old Mother. She loves it!,1
"Everyone debates how long batteries last and these work perfectly fine. As a college student who spends a ton of time playing Xbox, my roomates and I went through batteries by the dozen and were always short. Instead of taking them out of any device we coud get our hands on (remotes, calculators, etc) we decided to just get these in bulk. They are much cheaper than getting anything in store and last long enough that we didnt notice a difference. A pair in an Xbox 360 controller lasted a good 4 months with almost daily use which is better than most batteries in my opinion.",1
These last along time and are really power ful,1
"They came super quickly in the mail, they were very inexpensive compared to Duracell or energizer i would have bought at target and they are long lasting and work great!!!",1
Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product.,1
This a great item for kids to learn how to use electronics.,1
Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.,1
Great batteries! Can't beat the price.,1
good batteries for the price!,1
Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.,1
"Bought this 8"" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn't want the larger 10"" screen (yet).",1
This children's kindle is great! I can't say anything negative about this product! Perfect for my 3 yr old and even my older kids who are teens like to play with it! I highly recommend buying this if you're considering any educational products for kids. You won't be disappointed!,1
As good as durcell batteries.,1
was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store,1
Wow had these in my Xbox remote for 5 days non stop use and still a full charge !!!!!!,1
This is very durable for a young child. It is very easy to use even for my 2 yo granddaughter.,1
My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present,1
they are batteries and they make my battery powered stuff work so im not sure how this could get a low rating. for the price well worth it. that said they don't seem to last quite as long as other name brands.,1
Good gift for kids. My son likes to play the educational games i downloaded for him,1
"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine.",1
Perfect!,1
Great pack of batteries. Will definitely buy again.,1
Batteries at a good price.,1
"What a fun toy this is! It was easy to learn to use, and If I needed help, the online User's Guide is right there. Purchasing books couldn't be easier, and there's no ""hard copy"" to dispose of when you'e done. I was able to check out a book from the public library with little effort. With so many low-cost or no-cost books, as well as current best sellers, there's an endless number to choose from. You can use the search function to search by topic or title. I like using a stylus pen on the touch screen for that. I know I will enjoy my Kindle Voyage for a long time.",1
"I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price.",1
We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.,1
"They work, its a battery at a cheap price.",1
"This is the 3rd Kindle we have purchased and they keep getting a little nicer with each version. The light on this one is a really nice feature. The battery life is better, the page turning options are better, it is lighter... there are just a lot of nice little improvements. If you like to read in an electronic format I cannot imagine disliking the Kindle.",1
They're working great.,1
works as advertised,1
These are as good or better than the name brands you often see advertised on TV. Great price and I especially like the case they came in. I have been a repeat buyer on these batteries! Well worth it!!,1
I had no idea Amazon had their own line of items. These batteries are still going strong and were a great price. It seems like our household blows through batteries like there's no tomorrow so finding something that lasts is very important and Amazon has created a cost-effective way of achieving this.,1
Great purchase for your money. This brands lasts a long time and I received it double packaged in a timely manner. Definitely will buy these again in the future.,1
"Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money",1
Love buying batteries from Amazon. For this many it is a great price and you don't have to carry them home from the store.,1
I found the electrons in this brand of battery to be more uppity than in other brands. They get jiggy wi' it.,1
"I love this tablet, amazon did a great job with this one, Alexa is an added plus",1
"Just Came In Today, Half Of Them Already In Use. Frustration Free Packaging (As Described). Great Price. Would Recommend.",1
Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides.,0
"Purchased this for my fiance's youngest son for Christmas and also to replace his broken ""no name"" handheld. He loved it. The speed, ease of use and size were perfect for him. He mostly uses it for music, youtube and instagram..all of which seem to work fine on it. It was also very affordable. He's happy with it so we are too.",1
Easy to set up. East tie you. Would highly recommend this product to others,1
Has all the functionality a child needs with easy parental controls. Like the child profile with only approved content.,1
My son loves this tablet and so does his mom lol..,1
This is a newer version of the Fire I had previously and I love it. I like the camera. This version is lighter than the other. It is taking me a while to learn the differences but most of them are improvements.,1
I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends,1
I definitely recommend this tablet is so perfect for children.,1
"Good batteries, work exactly how you would hope",1
"Love my kindle it's the best size for the price. Wonderful applications to download for reading, play movies and music. A plus rating",1
This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.,1
Good cheap batteries,1
It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.,1
"No problems here! Using these for a variety of things, mostly just remotes and Xbox controllers though they have also been used in an external DSLR flash with no problems.",1
This portable Bluetooth speaker has an excellent sound which can be taken anywhere unlike the Echo and Echo Dot which both have to be plugged in. Want to listen to a favorite song? Just ask Alexa. Want to know the weather report? Just ask Alexa. Want to know your horoscope? Just ask Alexa. A lot of fun and entertainment at a great price. Big things come in small packages!,1
great price for great batteries. Used for gifts this year.,1
"Great value, just the right size and weight. Suits my needs perfectly. Performs very well. Easy to get accessories to fit.",1
"These are the best bargin high performance batteries that I have found. At this price, why purchase name brand disposable batteries",1
The Kindle and cover were a gift for my wife. Her previous one went to the big tech heaven in the sky. She loves both products and couldn't be happier with the products.,1
"Usually I buy bricks of batteries from Fry's Electronics, but I had an Amazon gift card, so I figured I would give them a shot and they make my devices work!",1
"Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with!",1
"These batteries are great, and a real value when you buy in bulk. I would highly advise you to buy more then you need because the higher you go the bigger discount you get. They come shipped in very good packaging, and packed tight to keep them safe. If you buy many the packaging can be used for safe storage.The performance of these batteries is about what you would come to expect from Amazon. They on on par with more expensive Energizer brand batteries. The shelf life on these is also around 10 years. While I'm a big advocate for lithium batteries, sometimes you just need a less expensive option and these are always my goto brand. You will be hard pressed to find a better value for your money in terms of batteries.",1
Love the apps. His old fire stood up to significant wear/tear and drops. So I'm expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind.,1
"Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick.",1
Works well for the price point and is completely comparable to name brand batteries. I will be purchasing all of my future battery needs from amazon basics.,1
These are great batteries at a great cost. I will continue to purchase these. I replaced batteries in my outdoor solar lights and I have many and these work great. Highly recommend.,1
Amazing quality and performance for the price. We only buy Amazon batteries now.,1
"Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices.",1
"My go to batteries. Good battery life with these, and they cost so little",1
"We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!",1
We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.,0
Glad I ordered this many. I had no idea I'd use nearly half the box as soon as I opened it. Now I need to do the same with AA size as many applications say specifically not to use rechargeables. Believe them! I tried it once before and pretty much melted down the item and destroyed the batteries as well. Apparently they are not made to supply as much current and they will let out the (magic) smoke. These came in quickly and are just what I needed,1
I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.,1
"lasted long, super reasonable price",1
Great for kids. Bought both colors for two of my kids.,1
"I'm really happy with these, they really surprised me. They're head to head with top brands eg. Energizer, Duralast, Raovac. I'm definitely going to buy my batteries from here now, they're such a good deal for such great performing batteries :)",1
"I was skeptical at first, but these AmazonBasics batteries are pretty competitive to Duracell and Energizer alkaline batteries.",1
This was a gift for my niece's birthday. She loves it .Plus the kid safe,1
Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.,1
Really good value for the money. There could definitely be less packaging material,1
"Bought this for my 2 year old son. He loves it. The case makes it so much easier for little hands to hold. He's dropped it a few times and it's pretty solid, no scratches!",1
"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.",1
Good batteries at a good price!,1
"Definitely not Duracell, but it gets the job done. Last for a while, but died sooner than expected.",0
less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen!,1
this is a Excellent Productis everything as expectedfits all the i need from a product like this one,1
Great buy.,1
"I love these batteries from Amazon and will continue to buy them for my controllers for gaming as they are strong enough to deal with them. I get a long life from these. As long as I do from my Duracells! I complete this review after either I or an immediate family member has tested the product thoroughly. Sometimes I have very little to say about a product if it works and it does what it is advertised. Sometimes I wax effusive, or rather poetic. Either way please be assured that we have tested the product and have been honest with you. If my review is helpful for you or makes sense, please indicate Yes below. Thank you for reading my review.",1
Great!!,1
"A perfect tablet for kids. The parental controls allow only age appropriate content and are customizable without spending hours digging through the settings. It comes with a 2-year no questions asked ADH warranty from Amazon, making the geek squad protection on this device irrelevant. It also comes with a free, 1-year subscription to amazon kids allowing unlimited access to almost any children‚Äôs show and apps (that are normally paid for).",1
"Work great in some devices but not some (like some brands of cordless mouse). Still, a good value for many uses.",0
I am a Duracell fan. I am one of those types who uses a volt meter to test batteries prior to installation and often when I remove them I test them to see what is left at the end of its useful life. Duracell batteries are usually a good bit higher in their new state then any other battery I have used on average. They also seem to go for longer life cycles then any other battery and go lower as far as discharge voltage goes. These batteries are the first and only ones that seem to be close to Duracell. These are a better deal as far as price per unit goes. The difference in performance is not enough to pay more for Duracell batteries.,1
"Holds a long charge. Fast great space, no freezing or resetting.",1
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it,1
Nice to look at. Easy to use. Decent price.sceen has decent resolution.,1
I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.,0
GoodGood,1
These batteries are as good as any national brand.,1
Great replacement for the expensive batteries,1
Longer life and great price,1
Only wish games worked without internet once downloaded,1
Batteries work (and last) as expected for a great price.,1
"The best Kindle ever, for me, is still the huge DX that Amazon used to make. But that is ancient history.With the current generation, I have owned the Voyager, and both the new and older versions of the Oasis (for all, wifi and 3g versions). I can tell you from these three devices this 2017 Kindle Oasis is the best and well worth the cost. It is fast, and that seemingly minor screen size bump actually is very big when you use the device to read.Also, the device is very fast. Page flips are very quick and the backlight is even and not distracting.Note that I only read Kindle books on the device. For technical documents the SONY EReader (DPTRP1/B) is probably the go to device, but its considerably more.",1
This Tablet is great and Fun to use. The screen is great on it,1
"great price, great product, works well in all my devices and flashlights, see no difference in performance compared to the national brands",1
Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading,1
We decided to buy the tablet so our toddler could play educational games on hers instead of going for my iPad. I love how we can block her from going on the Internet as well as set a curfew. It's easy to use and my daughter loves it!,1
They die pretty quickly.,0
"I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc.",1
TERRIBLE! Barely lasted three hours during a digital camera shoot where Duracell lasts multiple days.,-1
Easy to set up. I havent given it to my daughter yet... as I am afraid she will turn into a screen freak but I will be using it for lo g car rides.,1
"If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else.",1
Not reaching my expectations and it's okay to kids to play games,-1
"Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use.",1
This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.,-1
Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.,1
"At first I thought my reader was broken but discovered, by accident, that my touch must be very light.",1
"At the rate we go through AA batteries (5 grandsons and LOTS of toys), these are a great value.",1
"Grandson loves this tablet, does everything he needs",1
Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.,1
Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks,1
Delicious,1
Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
I meant to purchase AA not triple,-1
I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.,1
This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.,1
"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!",1
These Amazon batteries seem like a good value.,1
"I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it.",1
"The newest Kindle eReader (Voyage) is a very good upgrade over the current model. It has several new hardware & coming software enhancements over the current model. However, unless you do an extreme amount of reading, I would not recommend upgrading if you owned the current PaperWhite generation. The high price does not justify it.",1
"This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy.",1
Grandkids loved the tablets and they seem very durable and long-lasting,1
ok,1
not crazy about these batteries. don't last as long as others for same time period,0
The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage.,1
"Great quality product. I haven't done extensive testing or anything, but they seem to last just as long as Energizer batteries. All of the batteries worked as they should and the value was a good deal.",1
"Offers ability to use as a tablet, read, games and many other apps. Perfect to take on the go",1
Great Job -- Super Service..!!,1
"this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera",1
This is just what we needed for a you k8d ..the apps are great,1
Great price for a ton of batteries.,1
I need to cancel this auto shipment,-1
So far so Good !,1
"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time.",-1
"I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books....",1
"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them.",-1
"Decided to give these a shot and glad we did. Batteries work just fine and cost much less than the big name brands. We like to keep AA's on hand for remotes, flashlights etc. but they sure came in handy for Christmas! We'll definitely buy them again!",1
If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.,1
"Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance.",1
Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up,1
Good price good batteries .. 2nd time buying Amazon basic batteries .. Will buy more ....,1
"I liked it so much I got 2 and the battery life is amazing. I will buy more when ever they go on sale I have 8 grandkids, these would be perfect for them.",1
"I use these batteries in my game cameras and they work great, last several weeks.",1
"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!",1
"This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus",1
"These work just as well as name brands. I don't notice them draining any faster than the big names in the battery world. I'm glad I gave these a try, saves me money and the large package size means we don't run out! I'll be buying other sizes as needed. Highly recommended!",1
"great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn't that bad either",1
"Great products, great quality and a really good quantity . Thank you , I'm very happy with my purchase.",1
The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case,1
great batteries buy these save money,1
The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that,1
My best endorsement is: I'm a repeat buyer!,1
"Great batteries, works well in all my remotes and flashlights",1
Came as advertised. Batteries seem to last pretty long and the price was great. Even the paging they sent it in was greatPlease Vote YES on my review!! Thank you,1
Absolutely love this tablet. Many of the kid apps don't require wifi. My son is even able to watch Mickey Mouse clubhouse episode while in the car without any internet connection.,1
bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.,0
Great Batteries. Cost and shipping was well worth it.,1
Great product for myself! And I bought it when there was great deal on it!,1
"This is the first e-reader I've gotten and I LOVE it! In general, kindles are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on amazon that you can just carry around with you. The page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you don't like the sensors on the side. When you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off. Again, just something to get used to. It's really easy to navigate, you can even highlight and take notes. I don't really now too much about other e-readers or kindles but I'm really happy I bought this and I'd recommend it to anyone!",1
I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.,1
Best bargain in batteries I've found yet!,1
"We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!!",1
Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!,1
These are great. Best price I could find on Amazon. I'll be using these from now.,1
great price for the quantity - much cheaper than the store. appears to be a good quality from what I can tell. definitely will buy again.,1
"Fantastic, long lasting batteries!",1
Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!,1
"Dependable, as usual.",1
"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading.",1
"Love this tablet, it is better than my ipad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!",1
Got this for my teenage son (17) so that he could give his eyes and neck a rest from looking at media on his iPhone 7+ He totally loved it!,1
Great value.,1
Thank You!,1
The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case,1
The Amazon Tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music I like. It has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around. Thumbs up for the Tap!,1
I bought this for a gift and my little niece got in love with it,1
"They work really well, they do not drain quickly so that is a plus since I need them for my xbox controller.",1
"Work well, last as long as name brand batteries.",1
"What can I say Great price for double A's which I always need around! Not sure what the life is, but I was buying batteries at IKEA and I can't imagine these would be much different and the price was great. I'm a big fan of Amazon Basics!",1
good,1
"Very fast shipping arrived when stated., Great value for the price. Thank you",1
This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.,-1
Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages,1
Great learning tool for the grand kids. Helps with there homework.,1
"I was impressed with the overall of this Kindle, it has so many nice features and easy access.",1
Perfect!,1
Good batteries at a good price,1
They are batteries what can you say,1
"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed.",1
Ordered one for my daughter. It's the fourth Kindle we have bought and love them. Perfect for watching videos and movies.,1
"Last just as long as name brand, much cheaper.",1
"Bought 2 of these for my grandkids for Christmas. These are perfect and with the sale I bought them on, even better. I liked the 8 since the screen is a little bigger plus more memory than the 7.",1
I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.,0
The only problem I have with this is slow boot up time,1
I can listen to music during my bath. Also there are 39 games I can play and 40 I can't play yet. I am six.,1
Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...,0
Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.,1
I have had these only for a week I cannot tell you anymore,1
my son loves it. I have bought him tablets before but he never liked them as much. this one is easier to use.,1
"My kids love this and I love the fact that it is under $100 with warranty for 2 years added on. Best Buy has the geek squad that assists with repairs so that you don't have to ship it out. I also like the fact that it comes charged because come on lets be real, once the kids get it they want to use it right away.",1
thank you,1
my daughter enjoys her tablet reading the books for school & screen size is prefect,1
Who doesn't need a pack of batteries Economical and last a long time. I keep mine in the freezer and have never had a problem with them not being fully charged.,1
Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.,1
"This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad.",1
Nice deals on the product with saving and good customet experience.,1
Batteries work perfectly. Only problem is the packaging is a little large. You will need to put them in a smaller container unless u have a ton of cupboard space.,1
We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.,1
Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.,1
Purchased on black Friday deal for $59.99. Good buy! Not iPad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime videos and normal apps. Would purchase at standard price also as a fun extra tablet.,1
My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix!,1
Good deal!,1
"I got this for my kids and I am able to have parental control over all of them, put a time limit on play time, they each have their own apps, games and books that are appropriate for their age. My kids love it and they are learning! With this kids edition I get 1 free year of all kids appropriate app,games,videos and books!",1
I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top,1
"I didn't know how well he would do with a full blown tablet, but I am shocked at how well he navigates it ON HIS OWN. He does get stuck from time to time, but a few times and key words and he can pull up apps, close them, pause and play movies etc by himself. His vocal skills have improved and he is saying and identifying letters- and it has to be because of the tablet. I'm impressed at how well it holds his attention. His letter understanding (he's 3.5) has transferred off screen to the physical materials we use. Plus, it's a great motivation tool. I love it, and he does, too.",1
"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",1
great price,1
"I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one.",1
"I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it, so i love it.",1
"good value for the money, love the kindle for reading",1
they are batteries...what more can be said How long do they last who knows just got them.,1
"I dont know what I could possibly say that over 6,000 other reviewers have not already said.. so I won't even go into details. I needed more AAA batteries, and I am a amazon-junkie so I ordered their batteries. Popped three into a flashlight that needed batteries.. and I had light! They work.. Now how they will hold up over time, I do not know yet.. but they work for now and worked in my flashlight so I am happy with them!",1
"Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores.",1
"Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are dead. Low expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again.",-1
FAST Ship and batteries are working great!! Great price too!!,1
"The best device for a child in the market. Purchased for an infant and after two weeks, he is loving it. Easy to handle and durable.",1
I am very pleased with the dog crate. Very sturdy. No damage or flaws. Was better than some others that I have purchased in a retail store.,1
"convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too.",1
I bought this for my granddaughter she will be 2 in a few months and she loves it! Very sturdy and the bumper that it comes with has shown to do what it is intended to do. Would highly recommend this product for kiddos!!,1
great price,1
I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!,-1
"This is my second Kindle (the first one lasted several years). I enjoy the ability to read in the dark without background light. The backlight works very well and does not have the eye strain that a tablet may have. With the touch surface, I find it a little too sensitive and have accidentally moved several pages. The side page turn works very well. Much easier to travel with this unit than a large book.",1
Bought this for a 8 yr old and its perfect for what she like to do,1
Good replacement for a paperwhite. The addition of the page forward and page backward buttons is huge!,1
Great product easy to use. My niece loves it won't put it down.,1
The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good.,1
Works.,1
Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.,1
My son is obsessed with his kids kindle!! A must have so they stay off your phone !,1
This is a great tablet for a kid! It is easy to use and play on!,1
I had no clue Amazon basics did batteries- great price. Never buying from big box stores again!,1
I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading.,1
good value,1
"Between our toddler's toys and various household gadgetsremotes etc, we needed a lot of batteries! These battery value packs from Amazon are awesome! We've found that the Amazon basics batteries last almost as long as the big name brand ones do. They are a lot cheaper though and I don't see myself buying expensive name brand batteries anytime soon.",1
Cheap and works well.,1
CheapDon't last all that long,1
"Pros- Feels Light weight even when stuffed fully. Perfect no. of compartments.Cons - Poor zipper quality, side ouch for water container is small.",0
Great value.,1
I will from now on but Amazon battery's! Super cheap and they actually last when compared to other overly priced battery's. it's a no brainer.,1
"Bought this tablet for my son..great battery life, shipped fast..great value!",1
Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. Seems like this is geared more towards younger kids. Case is good though and keeps tablet safe. Would be tough to break!!,-1
Son loves it........................................,0
I have owned several Kindles and this is the best one yet,1
The only batteries that I buy now! Price is great and they seem to hold up as good as their more expensive competition.,1
great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features.,1
Bought for my 4yr old for Christmas. Love that they have a product that my child can learn from and enjoy as well. Great warranty. Thank you Amazon.,1
I purchased the kindle fire tablet for kids for my little one for his 5th birthday back in April. So far he loves it! I love the fact that it reads the books to him and he does too!,1
Holds charge well. Portable. Lightweight and as best we can tell nearly indestructible. Perfect for kids,1
"I had an older one which still works, but wanted a newer model.",1
"It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space.",1
Great deal for our office's most popular battery.,1
Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.,1
This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price.,1
We purchased 4 of these for our grandkids aged 18 months to 6 yrs and all 4 of them love them. They play with them daily for as long as their parental limits allow. They are very durable and come with a very kid durable skin. The 2 year warranty that covers everything was the selling part for us. The one con is that you don't get google play store.,1
"This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps",1
work as well as most any other battery,1
"I use these for remotes, and Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers, even after I get a low battery warning they still work a VERY long time and I can not tell any difference between these and more expensive brands. I will be buying more of these and possibly moving over to the rechargeable ones.",1
Good tablet nice color woeks well good screen size,1
We purchased three of these tablets for our granddaughters and they use them everyday and enjoy them. We spoke with one of the Best Buy associates and he was great telling us about this product. Made our decision easy. Thanks.,1
"great product, great transaction",1
"I purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. I opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It's fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student.",1
"My daughter loved her new tablet.. it was, what we expected.",1
I love the tablet....I just can't do without the tabelt,1
so far so good!,1
My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.,1
"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat.",1
Worked as well as normal batteries.,1
My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.,1
They are batteries and as such work just as expected.,1
So far batteries seem to be working fine. Will buy again.,1
"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.",-1
Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right,1
I love my tablet. It is super easy and loads fast.,1
Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!,1
"I love to read but don't have the space to keep a collection of books. For me, this Kindle is the best of both worlds. I can enjoy reading a good book without having to find shelf space to store it later.",1
"This tablet is the perfect size and so easy to use. Read, play games or any other purpose--it is great!",1
"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure.",0
They're batteries. They work. Mine came packaged fantastically in this little box. I couldn't want anything more.,1
You have no idea how badly we needed affordable batteries in our house! Thank you.,1
Good performance batteries.,1
Great value. Will order again.,1
"My daughter love her tablet. And is easy to use, and the battery last longer..",1
"I am a big fan of e-readers. I prefer the e-ink screens over tablet screen when reading books. I decided to pick up the new Kindle Voyage. Here are my thoughts.First, the Kindle is much sleeker and lighter than the Paperwhite model. It's very easy to hold for a long length of time without getting tired.Secondly, the addition of the page turn buttons is a welcomed addition. The buttons make it so easy to hold the Kindle with one hand and turn pages.Lastly the screen. I marked off a star because I had to return my first Voyage directly to Amazon because the top half of the screen had a yellow tint to it that was very distracting while reading. The replacement Kindle Voyage that I received had a perfect screen and the 300 ppi looks amazing. That being said, Amazon needs to really focus on quality control because I've read that the yellow tint on the screen is a common issue. If you're spending $200 for an e-reader, then the screen should be perfect. Especially since this is the 3rd generation of the lighted screens for the e-readers.If you're an avid reader, then the Kindle Voyage would be a worthy upgrade to make. If you're a casual reader who has a Paperwhite, you're probably okay with what you have.",1
Great value!,1
Basic Batteries,1
I love my fire hd I have read four books and play all my games on it.......it is an awesome deal for seventy-nine dollars .......it is a great tablet........like I said I love it ......,1
Great batteries. Great price. How can you go wrong,1
great Product,1
These are great batteries at a great price. Plain and simple. Don't be a dummy. Just buy them because you know you need a case of extra batteries.,1
"So far so good, batteries work as they should.",1
Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.,1
Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.,1
Trash. Only lasted a few hours.,-1
"I PURCHASED TWO FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN TO SHARE AND THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THEM, WHICH MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY! I NEED TO BUY HEAD PHONES NEXT!",1
"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire.",0
You can not beat the price and it is by a trusted name.,1
"I was not expecting much when i bought these batteries. I was proven wrong. Weve had these same batteries in everyday devices, including a kids toy that is used daily, for 2 months. With duracell batteries i was replacing them about once a month in this very same toy. They are still going strong. I will be buying these from now on. Name brands do not compare to these batteries.",1
This is my second kindle fire. It is much improved over the last one. Very easy to use. Especially like the Alexa feature.,1
My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games.,1
I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational.,1
"What can I say, it's a battery",1
"these batteries last a long time, very happy to have found them on such a great deal",1
Works just like echo but portable!! Great stuff. As described!,1
These batteries just don't seem to last as long as Everready batteries.,0
"bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music.",1
An excellent way to get batteries at a good price without having to tote them home.,1
Using the Kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable.,1
Good buy.,1
"works great, easy to use. play videos and game good",1
My three year old loves his. It has been a life saver on car rides.,1
Great.,1
Great price,1
Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM,1
Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily,1
"Inexpensive, and they last as long as the pricey ones. I wish Amazon had a bigger pack of assorted batteries.",1
"I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members).",1
"This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school.",1
I used to prefer paper or hardback books but found I had more access to read online. With the kindle I have been able to access my growing library and the battery life is amazing.,1
Great price and great quality!,1
I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.,0
Used to have an iPad but I hated it became obsolete. I love my kindle fire and BestBuy was great!!!,1
Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend....,1
Such a great deal. Very happy with this purchase. Will def order again.,1
What can I say about a battery,1
Great price and work just as well as the more expensive ones.,1
Smaller version but works great just like the bigger product.,1

Bought this as Christmas gift for son. Good value for money and ease of use.,1
The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.,1
Purchased for my 83 years young husband who is an avid reader. Getting his books instantly was worth his fear of going to a kindle. He's surprised at the ease of use.,1
Runs out of power fast.,0
Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere!,1
"Shipped fast, boxed perfectly and work great and last as long as name brand batteries! Good price good buy :)",1
This was a great Christmas gift for our grand daughter.,1
Replaced original paper white with this new model and the recipient just loves it!!,1
Great product easy to use. My niece loves it won't put it down.,1
My son truly loves his Kindle. He uses it everyday.,0
Child loves the kindle and is very user friendly for both child and adult.,1
killer deal,1
Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It's also HD which is a plus,1
lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle,1
"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet.",-1
Thanks AAAAA+++++++,1
I love how efficiently Amaozon packages their batteries. They seem to hold up comparably to other name brand batteries. Also they are so inexpensive!,1
Bunch of AA batteries. Been working fine. Seems to be a good value.,1
I like how i got so many itd months later and i still got a pack left!!,0
This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen,1
Easy to use and very affodable. My kids love this tablet.,1
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.,1
Very awesome tablet for kids and great parental controls,1
Cheap and easy batteries in an easy open package that is also recyclable and good for storage. Perfect for those toys (child and adult toys) that are constantly using batteries. I wish Amazon offered a package with prepaid return postage for recycling. I would pay an extra dollar or something if I could pack them back in the box and ship them back to Amazon for recycling. YOU HEAR THAT AMAZON,1
Good price for batteries - will order more as the need arises,1
This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.,-1
"Our kids love it and the Amazon unlimited is fantastic with tons of options. However, our kids still fight over usin our grownup tablet bc the screen is larger.",1
"The Amazon Kids Fire keeps my grandson captivated with lots of activities. He loves that it's just right for his little hands. He makes sure that everyone in the family knows the Kindle belongs to him by saying, ""It's mine!""",1
My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.,1
"I bought this for my MIL, who loves Kindle and podcasts, but finds it harder to get to her desktop to get online. This tablet has me thinking seriously why I paid nearly 1,000 for an ipad (my 4th). The screen is gorgeous and the setup is easy. Ok, I'll confess, I bought it because of the yellow body--our favorite color and easy to find in a pile of books!",1
"Rated by Consumer Reports as recommended, this is a good battery at a great price. True, it does not match the latest Energizer Ultimate Lithium, but that battery is far more expensive. These batteries come packed in a plain brown box, and sealed in clear plastic by twos.",1
"I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked.",1
Strong amount of features and very fast. Easy to use tablet that my daughter is really enjoying.,1
Seem to work very well at a great price.,1
It seems like these batteries are the only ones that my clock works with.,1
Very easy to use and with amazon have loads of books to access,1
Super nice and affordable great price excellent quality and works just as good as an iPad or android tablet,1
This is for my 10 year old. Love the parental settings,1
My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon'so description,1
I bought one and gave this one as a gift- much appreciated and great price.,1
Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.,0
She loved it! Perfect for viewing movies and playing games!,1
I'm loving my kindle fire. It does everything I need it to do and more.,1
Well it is not for me but it looks very nice for young kids...,1
"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)",0
Breaks down too fast and won't run my trail camera but around 6 hours.,-1
Great batteries!,1
We love the free time feature. Definitely going to end up subscribing after the free year trial is up. Our 2 year old loves it and we can control how long she's on it.,1
My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,1
"Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos.",1
I can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them.,1
I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.,1
These are alright batteries works well on remotes and other little gadgets. I just like my energize battery or the copper top battery myself but my husband got these for the smaller items around here.,1
I use these in every thing in the house. They last just as long as the name brand batties.,1
i upgraded from an older kindle that wasn't backlit. The quality and ease of use is much better and I love the backlit feature!,1
Good value for these will purchase them again.,1
"this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse",1
"We go through a lot of batteries in our house, so when I saw these come up on a lightening deal, I swooped them up! Amazon makes great products.",1
Worth the price,0
This was bought as a replacement for my wife's previous kindle. She is loving the larger screen and the fact that it has a camera.,1
Good Value and Price. Good Charge life. I will be buying more soon.,1
use lots of the Amazon Basics batteries and they seem to work as well as more expensive brands,1
Better priced then BJs! Awesome deal,1
"easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load",1
Great buy.,1
A++++,1
I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.,1
Very happy with the HD Fire 16GB. Plenty of memory and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend this item.,1
"Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it.",1
Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders,1
all ok,1
"Don't last as long as Duracell, but they are reasonably priced to make up for it.",1
Great product - as described.,1
I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.,1
"It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value.",1
Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage.,1
He loves being on it and all the freebies that came with it.,1
light and compact and a little slow with the apps and images,1
"You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it.",1
good batteries good price,1
Price was just right.i would recommend to someone.,1
"My two daughters really enjoy using their Fire tablet. It is really easy to use, sturdy, high definition, has tons of awesome apps integrated for children. My girls were Apple users, yet it was easy to transition.",1
Works well.,1
Great Value,1
"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item.",1
"I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though.",1
Exactly as described. I'll learn if they last or not.,1
"Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun.",1
Just as good as the expensive stuff.,1
"Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc.",1
I gave this as a gift to a teenager. She uses it mostly for facebook and to play some games. It works fine for her. She had another smaller version of this fire that only lasted a year. I hope that this one will out last that one!!,1
"Easy to use, love the color and my daughter loves it. Easy to set up very happy with my purchase.",1
Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!,1
Works excellent love it. Easy to use,1
The price is cheaper that the other famous brands. It works just as great as the other ones. Since when Amazon started selling their brand's battery I am a fan1 of it. I buy AA and AAA. I truly recommend this brand.,1
This is great for kids and for the price. However they don‚Äôt last that long. If you know that ahead of time you won‚Äôt be disappointed,1
"If you are getting this, get it on a sale!!It slow and choppy, but it's decent for light media consumption and browsing.",0
These work like any other battery at half the price! They are long lasting and easy to use.,1
"This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend.",1
Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.,1
As advertised. Is what it is. Great value.,1
They're batteries. They work.,0
"Small enough to carry every where. When he is using it, you can hear a pin drop.",1
Ok,1
Not happy at all very slow compare to others I ordered,-1
"Maybe we have a bad batch because all the other Amazon Basics batteries we have are great.. So far numerous AA batteries are leaking in remotes, toys, and other electronics.",-1
The batteries came packaged great and have lasted a good amount of time so far. They come in at just a couple cents per battery under Costco and Sams Club batteries so I thought I would give them a try and they were definitely worth it!,1
Bought this for a gift for some one who's old tablet won't work. Just the right size to play games on.,1
Great for my kiddo! He loves to watch Sesame Street on it :),1
Price cheaper or similar to my local warehouse store without having to go to the store. Or in a smaller quantity. I have purchased several times. They just work.,1
"Not a lot of memory, dies fast. Great games........",0
Great speaker and Echo substitute. This is great for on the go as a Bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the Alexa app.,1
Great product at great price. Last just as long as ones I buy from store. With having young kids these are well worth it,1
I got this for my grandson and he just loves it! Durable and easy to manage.,1
Seemingly sufficient at a good price!,1
"Some day we will probably look back and chuckle about 'primitive' batteries like these. But not yet. They are an integral part of our daily lives. We need food, drink, shelter, love, and BATTERIES! You can't beat the price/quality combination.",1
"Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!",1
good,1
Amazon basics AA batteries are satisfactory for the cost. Being Alkaline the seem to work fine in most things.,1
This is my second Kindle Fire and I wouldn't be without one. Excellent little device for reading books and playing games. Use it daily to watch Netflix.,1
"bought these for remote control vehicle, they lasted pretty long, several hours , so they did the job",1
for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it,1
I replaced another Kindle Fire that was broken after I sat on it! I liked all the Fires that I have had so much that I bought another and it is still in use.,1
Great product! Affordable and reliable!,1
I like to read and the kindle is great. It's easy to carry with you. You can buy affordable books. I also like the fact you can access the internet.,1
Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime.,1
"Nicely packaged in a very sturdy rectangular cardboard box that serves to store the batteries. Started installing the fresh batteries in my devices the moment I received them, beginning with a thermostat and two remotes. Still have 42 to use and share. My only quibble is that I would have liked to find a 24- or at least 36-battery AmazonBasics package offering. I hope these alkalines stay strong in storage.",1
good deal,1
These batteries work great.,1
"What can I say about batteries, they work, priced well.",1
My daughter love it she don't really brother me it keep her so busy,1
We absolutely love this bulk pack of AA batteries by AmazonBasics! We find that they perform up to the quality of other well known battery makers (Energizer or Duracell) but at a much more economical price! It's also great to have this bulk product aroind the house when you have kids or a gadget crazy husband!,1
AA Batteriers....they power stuff i want to use pretty good,1
good batteries.,1
"As a Mom of 3 young kids, we go through batteries very quick! I've tried all types of batteries from name brand, to various store brands. Amazon compares to the top brands I've used, and in fact I would consider it a top brand. They last twice as long in my son's wireless PlayStation controllers than the Toys R Us brand we were previously using. You can't beat the price for the quality and I will only buy Amazon batteries from now on!",1
Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!,1
"Haven't use it, but looks good.",1
I tested the lifespan of these batteries with my Wireless mouse. Lasts just as long as Duracell CopperTop AAA.,1
Perfect and I love this product.,1
Kids enjoying by using this tablet. It looks so pretty!!,1
Item arrived on time and was as described,1
GREAT!,1
My grandson loves it. Will be getting another one.,1
This deal is beyond amazing. Come Christmas this box of batteries for the kids toys is going to be a great deal. I was able to fill everything that took batteries in the house and they last quite a while too,1
OK,1
The Amazon fire tablet is a great gift for kids of all ages . Ez and fun to use keeping kids entertained while giving them educational tools to use at their grade level and hire.,1
Brought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it! Great product for the price.,1
I actually like them I see some people saying they don't like them but they actually work really good for me. I use them for my xbox one controller I play a lot. the first ones I used lasted pretty long I can't tell you how long exactly but it had to be around 6 or 7 days playing for about 3 sometimes 4 hours a day so I'd say that's pretty good. Im using my second ones now still pretty good so 5 stars all the way for me,1
"Great cost/cell option. Capacity isn't the best, but works great in low draw devices like remotes, etc.",1
"I bought it for my husband for a gift but I use it as much as he does. Perfect size, good sound quality overall great product.",1
"Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet.",1
We have our son Christian with autism he needs a tablet that can with stand being dropped these TABLETS are tough as nails.,1
As this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but I will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the Kindle intact. I am very happy with this purchase as is the child. Not to heavy and she can hold it with no problem.,1
"I've been using the Amazon Basics batteries for some time. I get them on subscribe and save.These are not meant to be heavy duty or super long life. They last reasonably long for my purposes and the price is extremely fair. These are so inexpensive that I don't expect them to last as long as the name brands and therefore I don't worry about it. I feel they do a very good job for the way I use them (mouse, keyboard, mini flashlight, small radio, etc.) and will continue to order the Amazon Basics in both the AA and the AAA sizes.",1
Great!! Replaced older Kindle. Much better version!,1
My 4yo loves this. He can maneuver it easily to go from different games and videos. Stays charged a long time.,1
Very pleased with the quality of this tablet and I was fortunate that it was on sale at the time of purchase,1
"Lets see how long the last. If they don't last long, I will lower the rating.",1
Unbeatable price,1
Very happy with these!!,1
"I never use amazon batteries before,but I love it, It's good for the price,it last just as long as duracell batteries, and the design of the batteries is just cute",1
They last a while and are cheap. What more could you want,1
These batteries are a great price. I need to use them and see how long they last before giving a higher review.,1
This met my expectations and more. My granddaughter loves it. It's user friendly and has unlimited options for her. Would recommend to everyone!,1
"The grandkids love this tablet, easy for them to use",1
purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software,1
"Purchased this for my fiance's youngest son for Christmas and also to replace his broken ""no name"" handheld. He loved it. The speed, ease of use and size were perfect for him. He mostly uses it for music, youtube and instagram..all of which seem to work fine on it. It was also very affordable. He's happy with it so we are too.",1
Just as good as the big name brands...excellent value.,1
I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great.,1
Good deal on basic batteries. Needed several pairs for tv remotes and these worked perfectly!,1
This tablet is perfect and appropriate for my grandchild,1
"Bought this for my grandniece, keeps her entertained. Can't beat the price.",1
My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.,1
This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.,1
"¬†I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it.",1
Bought this tablet for my five-year-old son he plays it every single day loves it great kid friendly tablet,1
"My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids.",-1
Great price and great performance. I loaded 10 of these batteries into my Field Camera 6 months ago and the camera is still taking pictures.,1
Arrived on time. Great for baby toys,1
Good product and price.,1
"Everything we have around the house uses batteries, so we go through them fast. I like purchasing in bulk because I don't have to purchase them as often and they are a little cheaper that way. I was a little nervous to purchase the AmazonBasics brand, because I wanted to make sure that I purchased a quality battery. We normally purchase Duracell.I am happy to see that the quality is just as good as the other brands we've purchase and at a fraction of the cost.We will be purchasing these again in the future.",1
Excellent,1
I hope that Azi will like to have her own entertainment instead of playing games on the cell phone.,1
"This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time.",1
Works better than what I thought! Keeps the kids entertained for hours at the same time they are learning.,1
"With a great child-proof case, this was the perfect tablet to start my little guy off with!",1
I bought for my 5 year old. Easy for her to use. Easy for me to track and control screen time.,1
"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it.",1
"Everything is locked out to Amazon, no compatibility with the Google Play Store and a lot of games the children play are on the Play Store. This product is bad because it is locked into only Amazon services.",-1
Just as great as name-brand batteries! The only difference seems to be the labels.,1
Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.,1
"My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It's a great way to stay preoccupied.",1
i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.,1
It was great,1
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me,1
Enjoy all of the downloads. I am an avid reader and enjoy the books.,1
I love it.,1
I am suprised at how well this tablet works compared to the Samsung tablet it replaced for $50 less.,1
My great-granddaughter loves this tablet. She plays so many games and watches her favorite cartoons. She just completed kindergarten and everything is programmed for her age. Best gift ever!!!!,1
Great product,1
Great price. Works like a charm!,1
"My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help",1
my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive.,1
The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.,1
We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up,1
I bought an 8 pack that worked perfectly so perfect that I later bought a 20 pack. The 20 pack I had an issue with that was quickly resolved. the issue wasn't enough to deter me from buying in the future. These are really good batteries and I'll definitely be buying these again.,1
"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds.",1
As this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but I will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the Kindle intact. I am very happy with this purchase as is the child. Not to heavy and she can hold it with no problem.,1
"Arrived earlier than expected. Amazon batteries are not only affordable, but have a long life.",1
Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier.,0
"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!",1
They work - that's about it.,1
First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small.,1
I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.,1
Just as good as any other battery in the market place-highly recommended,1
"Great price, work as long as any other battery",1
"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking.",1
Batteries come in small boxes of their own which makes it easier to organize and store. Love it !!,1
Good value.,1
"great quality, price and convenient to have available at all times",1
I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes.,1
We have had a number of tablets but non of them have been as user friendly as this one. My son loves it and it is super easy for him to find his apps.,1
"Great batteries! I was concerned to buy an off brand battery but these really work well. We have used these in the kids toys, in electronics, in remotes and have found that they are holding up very well!I normally only buy Duracell or Energizer so I am not switching batteries out in toys constantly and will be using this brand in the future as they are very well priced and work great.",1
we brought this tablet for our 6 yr old for Xmas and she loves it!. it was the go to tablet as she was always playing on my fire tablet... recommend for kids,1
Just batteries what can I say.,1
I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.,1
I'm planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!`,-1
So far hasn't been bad but there have been a few batteries with really low life span.,1
So it is working great. She loves the learning games,1
good,1
Was a gift for 7 yr old granddaughter she just loved it one of her favorite item she plays with. It goes with her almost everywhere,1
I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make),-1
The product it amazing love that it turns in lights on and plays my favorite music.,1
I read a lot of digital comic books and graphic novels. I wanted to get a cheap tablet just for that purpose.it does a wonderful job,1
"Delivered as promised, well packaged ... only problem ... does NOT appear to be waterproof ... not a good thing with these heavy South Florida rains.",1
Worked as expected,1
"Additional info now a couple of months later... We were very disappointed in these batteries as they did not last long at all. We put one in a regular kitchen clock and within 1 week, the time was off by 20 minutes. Put them in a different clock, same results, time was off by 10 minutes within a few days, put them in a battery op shaver, which the other brands most of the time last at least a month, these lasted about a week. Even a small weather station about a week until the time was wrong. Got the 20 pack, not sure if it was a bad batch but we do not recommend these batteries and wont buy them again. Store brands and Rayovac last much longer. Original review below, still stands as easy opening but did edit to say how disappointed we are.Amazon basics AA batteries EASY OPEN packaging is FABULOUS, no cut fingers on sharp plastic packaging and no need for scissors, opened like a dream.... GREAT IDEA!!! Haven't had them long enough to see how long lasting they are.",0
This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.,1
This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one,1
Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.,1
This children's kindle is great! I can't say anything negative about this product! Perfect for my 3 yr old and even my older kids who are teens like to play with it! I highly recommend buying this if you're considering any educational products for kids. You won't be disappointed!,1
These have lasted just as long as other brands we've tried yet at a better price point. We'll be coming back to this brand once we've used up this pack. Great to have some extras on hand with the value pack.,1
No wife loves reading books on it. It's a good size,1
"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price.",1
perfect!,1
I will recommend for other parents to buy this product,1
"Always looking for AA batteries, controllers for Xbox seem to need a lot of batteries. Nice packaging, too.",1
Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote.,-1
"I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance.",1
I love this and it's great for kids got it for a early Christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it,1
The tablet itself works fine but this is the 2nd one I have gotten with a similar problem. The port seems to come defected. The charger doesn't stay in and it takes a long time to charge. Replaced charger with a brand new one and it still has issues.,-1
Keeps the kids busy with games and activities and they really like it,1
Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case,1
These batteries seem to be really good they hold up just as long as nine brand we use them in our two way radios and our headlamps,1
"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.",1
As described,1
I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!,1
I reccomend this tabley yo every one. I purchased it for my brorher and he live it.,1
"This is my first e-reader. I like it so far. Easy to use interface. The ads can be kind of annoying, but keeps cost lower.",1
"These batterys last just as long as any other name brand, they are good.",1
"Utterly worthless, no staying power.",-1
While it isn't the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do. It gets on the social media sites and the internet. If you're expecting more from yoru tablet then don't look for one at this price. You'll need the more powerful ones that translate to bigger price tags. I've watched movies on this from my Amazon prime account and have read my books from my Kindle account and everything works well. It's not at lightening speed but it does get there in a timely manner!,1
Lots of batteries for a real decent price. Will have check back to confirm they are a great deal !,1
Good battery,1
My son LOVES it! Easy to use and download books. Requested for his Birthday gift.,1
I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.,1
Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price.,1
Purchased for my grand child. They love it. They play and add gamehis.,1
great,1
Great value for a ton of batteries for our way too many kid toys !,1
Great price works great I have no complaints about the product I would recommend to any one that loves kindle,1
"Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won't keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth",1
I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand,1
great buy,1
"Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of ""Alexia"".",1
good,1
Excellent...,1
"These batteries do what batteries need to do. I'm writing a review b/c this was an Alexa deal, which she told me was 5, and was charged 8.",1
"I have always enjoyed reading. I read to quickly and eventually spend a load of money on one book series. This product has already saved me at least $80, and i've only had it for a month. Yes I did the math! I love this thing!",1
"They work great and come in excellent packaging!I can't vouch for their lifespan vs the big brands, since I haven't paid attention to how long my old batteries would last. It's at least comparable! Comparable enough that the discount on AmazonBasics batteries is definitely worthwhile!",1
"They're batteries. Came packaged well, doing the job.",1
Great price and they last just as well as the name brand. Will buy again as needed.,1
A good tablet at a good price. Good it has expandable memory for watching movies and more pictures.,1
Great e reader. Preffered the brighter display of the voyage over the paperwhite. Happy with 3G connection for all time access.,1
"Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it.",1
"Batteries do not last! Don't waste your money on these. I've been using them in a weight scale where 4 batteries would last 4-6 months. With these batteries, I only get 10 days of usage. No battery life.",-1
Product arrived on time. Good batteries.,1
"Perfect travel compainion for long trips. Can read, watch movies, play games & listen to music",1
My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.,1
I got this for my three year old for Christmas and she loves it!,1
Save yourself a lot of frustration when you need new batteries by purchasing this package of AAs and having them on hand. They are long lasting and so nice to be available for those must-have times.,1
Why pay a penny more. They are exactly the same as Duracel or Energizer.,1
"My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time.",0
She loves to be on the tablet all the time . So now she will have her own.,1
Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts' content. They ar ed really fast too.,1
Great price,1
Feel like these loose their charge much faster than the brand I used to buy. Will not purchase in the future.,-1
Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web,0
good for the cheap price,1
"The larger one was bought for me as part of a Christmas gift...I enjoyed mine so much that I bought this one for a birthday gift.....sturdy, stylish, padded and protects well. Good buy for the price",1
"This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds.",1
So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .,1
DIDN'T SEEM TO LAST AS LONG AS OTHERS BUT NOT REAL BAD,1
Nice,1
Great Value. I'm sure Anazon doesn't have a battery company.,1
It serves its purpose.,1
"So far I have been very happy with this tablet. It is fast and user friendly. The camera is not very useful as the quality is lacking, but for me it does not make much of a difference.",1
"Love it, had the stick and it was kinda slow navigating. This one is much faster. Was going to use this and cancel cable. When I told my cable company I wanted to cancel and I was just going to stream everything they cut my bundle cost by 100. I kept cable but I also still use my firetv alot.",1
Love the amount of time we can set that she can be on this! The bumper guard has been handy. Apps that were on it are awesome. Best of all she loves it!,1
batteries do well in most of the electronics we own. There is not a noticeable difference between name brands and these.,1
Definitely got my money worth when I got this product the day after thanksgiving and it was well worth it! My son had a kids kindle so I already knew how to get around it from having to use and set up his. Easy to use. Can‚Äôt load alot of extra and it‚Äôs a tad slower right now due to getting one with a smaller memory but nothing a bigger memory card won‚Äôt solve :),1
"Work very well, works well for a family that goes thru batteries quickly!",1
short battery life,-1
"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME.",-1
It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.,1
Do not last long.,-1
Thank you!,1
Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic,1
This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.,-1
This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.,1
Good battery pack,1
"I like how it plays music. It is perfect to connect to smart home products. Such as nest, Belkin , and many others. It is easy to use.",1
AS EXPECTED,1
"I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase.",1
I bought this for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. It has many games and other games can be downloaded. She is also able to watch videos and mom can set parental controls to limit time and usage.,1
As described and fast ship/arrival. Thanks!,1
Good batteries,1
"My son is constantly distracted and loves technology. Him being only two years old, this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble.",1
Great deal on batteries.,1
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She reads books and plays games.,1
"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars.",1
"Decent batteries, great price.",1
Purchased for a gift. Person receiving it loved it and is extremely happy with it.,1
Great to have as a backup,1
"For the price, unbeatable.",1
Great price and works as well as the name brands!,1
"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music.",1
good quality,1
The product is easy for grandson to operate and navigate through and seems to be very durable,1
Nice battery and price. Have not had any problem with them.,1
Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids.,1
They're batteries!,1
Excellent price,1
They work great. Best value on batteries.,1
I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot!,1
Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix.,1
Cheap quick and easy. Best battery bundle.,1
Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you,1
Very easy for a child to be able to use and enjoy.,1
Great price for batteries!! They do the job as expected! I was nervous they wouldn't last as long because they were so cheap but they last just as long as name brands.,1
"Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well.",1
This was just the right screen size. We were price shopping and luckily found it on sale too.,1
"Great product. Excellent for small business, kids etc. Good on the go.",1
"Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge...",1
Amazon Battery Offerings are Great!,1
"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting.",1
This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!,1
Got this the another day for my niece and she loves everything it has to offer,1
"Amazon Basics has a quality battery supply, not just in A4A size. These batteries lasted as long as I would expect the Costco brand and Duracells I also have in my possession to last.I love Amazon Basic for quality and cost-savings on a variety of products!!I just ordered the 12-pack of Amazon Basic RECHARGEABLE AAA ones tonight since the disposables stood their ground as a great battery!!!",1
Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.,1
"This was a gift, Liked it so much that we went back and purchased another as another gift.",1
Great deal for our office's most popular battery.,1
These are OK for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Costco Kirkland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.,0
My daughter loves her tablet! She's only two and has learned how to use and navigate with ease.,1
works so far,1
"These work pretty well. They don't seem to last quite as long as Duracell or Energizer, but for the price I will continue to buy.",0
works like any another.,0
My son uses the device to help him do his homework,1
"Nice batteries, good price.",1
love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table,1
These work just fine. Have them in my flashlight and beard trimmer and they last. Definitely gonna keep buying these.,1
"I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen.",1
They do the job.. no issues at all,1
Good deal,1
Good price and they work,1
Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.,1
"This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture.",1
"This is the very best devise to read from. The print is one hundred percent book like. The device is light, elegant and a pleasure to use. There is nothing that comes close.",1
Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.,1
Just as advertised,1
"Non name brand batteries usually freak me out a little, but these actually work pretty well. I drain batteries pretty fast, and so far these hold up like Duracell.",1
great price,1
fab case for any laptop would buy another again i got it for my laptop and it is fine and strong plenty of pockets,1
Worked fine for me. Good charge,1
"Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!",1
Batteries did not last very long!,-1
"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.",1
my son loves it and is easy to use and has parental controls so he can't buy stuff without permission,1
Excellent,1
"My granddaughter was thrilled to see her new tablet on the day of her birthday. The color and size was perfect for her little hands. She could not wait for the tablet to charge. She kept asking if the tablet was ready to turn on. When the tablet finally charged, she could not put it down. She went from room to room showing her brothers what she could do with her tablet. Everybody wanted to do something with her tablet. As a parent, I just love the rubber bumper. The rubber bumper around the tablet is an excellent bonus to the tablet. It helps protect the tablet if it drops or falls accidentally. We all know how little hands sometimes drops things more than once. I only wish we could have bought this tablet much sooner. Being a first grader this year, my granddaughter can really benefit while using this tablet. Also, there are many educational opportunities for young children to engage themselves in instead of being glued to the television on a daily basis. This tablet is more child-centered and parental controlled.",1
This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.,1
Worst batteries ever. I use them in my remote and have to switch them every couple of weeks. Do not buy,-1
These work well and seem to last just as long as more expensive brands!,1
"Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8"" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7"" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable.",1
great value,1
Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.,-1
So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.,1
Can't go wrong with a good value on high quality batteries. I love AmazonBasics for helping me save money. Batteries are great quality and price!,1
"First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife.",1
So far they seem to work okay,1
My son loves playing with this tablet. Very easy to keep him entertained,1
had it for my xbox controller it works really good.,1
Excellent batteries at a food price,1
Very pleased with the product and performance. Easy and fast to download content - such as movies and music. Took on a recent trip and now wished I had bought one sooner - fits right in back pocket of my DSLR camera bag. Only draw back was unexplained power loss - as described by other reviewers. After a day it came right back on - suggest it might be a recharging problem as after a full charge it is working fine again. For the price and content available - great buy.,1
Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we'll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy.,1
Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it,1
"we bought tablet for my grandson, he really likes it",1
"A few dollars more, but I am boycotting amazon",1
ya....fine .....I mean its a battery .....How long they gonna last,1
"Works very well, great value. I would highly recommend.",1
"The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books.",1
These die really quick.,-1
Great product. Fast shipper!,1
Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.,1
I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!,1
This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.,0
Great batteries. Work well in our devices needing this size.,1
"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription.",1
We got these as an upgrade for the kids' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues.,1
Great value for high volume of batteries.,1
Excellent Value.,1
"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.",1
"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them.",-1
My son has enjoyed his tablet very much. He loves listening to the pandora music.,1
Good age appropriate learning tool for kids. There is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored. Overall a good tablet for the kids.,1
"I have an LG tablet but picked up this one for my Dad and after messing with it for a while it's very nice,. I think I like it more the my LG g pad!",1
My 3yo loves it and never wants to put it down. Lots of preloaded educational games and videos!,1
"This is a solid tablet for the money, great size, easy to use",1
Awesome product for kids who are looking to learn more,1
This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!,0
"My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on.",1
"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store",0
"not just for the kids, for the tablet challenged (me) I find it easy to work with",1
We got this tablet for my son and it has been a great fit. The screen is sharp but the tablet is a little sluggish. Considering the price and that it is intended for children I think it is great.,1
I have been using Amazon Basics Batteries for some time now. They are just as good as the name brands that cost a good bit more. We don't use as many disposable batteries as we used to but even after being stored for some time the quality does not seem to degrade. There is no reason to waste money purchasing the brand names when the Amazon Basics are of the same quality.,1
One of the batteries was dead right out of the package. The other three in the pack was fine.,0
Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.,1
"It's not a high discharge battery, but for typical uses such wireless mouse and flashlights, these are great.",1
I love my Kindle. It's light and I haven't experienced nnby problems with it thus far. I just wish I could upload my music from Google Play on here,1
Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks.,1
I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.,1
This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great,1
I've been ordering these since Amazon started to provide their own product as having a 1 year old means you always need to have batteries available at the drop of a hat! Never had any issues and always fast fulfillment on Amazon's end!,1
Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books.,1
excellent price for these batteries.,1
As good as the more expensive ones!,1
I own 3 Kindles. They are my favorite hand held technology so it was an easy decision to buy my great niece one for her birthday. The case helps make it even more sturdy so it can stand up to being dropped more often than an adult would. It's easy to use and she loves it.,1
First off I can't get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it.,1
Great batteries for the price.,1
great buy !!,1
Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.,1
I only buy amazon batteries now. can't beat em,1
Good Batteries,1
"This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered.",1
Great,1
"This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc.",1
"Price is good but I don't think these batteries perform as well as their peers. Reading reviews from actual electricians, I think they agree.I love Amazon products but wouldn't buy these again (unless they were more than half off their competitor's prices).",0
GOOD QUILTY PRICE GREAT,1
I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my flameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. None of those worked either So I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don't understand.,-1
"This is my second Kindle and I couldn't be happier . I couldn't believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere .",1
Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift,1
Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............,1
i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!!,1
Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : ),1
"I like the heavy card board box they come in. The strength (AAA, AA, C, etc) is printed on the side of the box. This gives you the ability to stack your batteries in a common 'emergency equipment' location so you know where to go when you need one. With the plainly marked sides, you can instantly see which box you want. This will gladly replace our current system: open a package of batteries, take 1 or 2, then put the rest back - someplace. We have batteries all over the place: some in in baggies, some loose in drawers, some still in their original packaging.",1
Can't beat the price,1
"Batteries work well, kids love having the battery stash for toys, can't beat the Amazon price on these.",1
It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot,1
"I never tested them for output, but based on experience they appear to work just as well as any other batteries we purchased in past, and price is better",1
"Better than the 7 inch..by an inch, Nice little cheap tablet to use and abuse and not think twice about it.",1
thanks,1
"Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift!",1
I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they definently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.,0
"Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain.",1
I purchased these mainly for my remote controls. It's been several months and they are still strong.,1
Great value.,1
Bought for my 5-yr old grandson. It's great & easy for him to use. I have an 8gb myself. Love the Amazon Fire. The price is very affordable.,1
Very good!,1
they hold there charge seem as good as high priced ones,1
everything was as I expected.... and order it online and pick it up next day... easy to do...,1
Great place to purchase batteries,1
Great price,1
"My niece is 2 years old and she absolutely loves this tablet. It's easy for her to use and navigate through. Plus, it has parental controls which I love. Definitely recommend it.",1
Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.,0
Great product Thank you!,1
I thought theses would be crap like the typical cheapo batteries. But to my delight they are actually pretty decent quality. They do not last as long as I would like but for the price I can not complain.,1
"We have dropped it a few times and the case is great. There is a ton of memory, great price. And how did I never know about Amazon underground. It's a great product and great price. I definitely recommend",1
If you want a cheap tablet that won‚Äôt break the bank this is the one for you. I use this tablet to play music though my Bluetooth speaker while working out.,1
"Awesome delivery time, product was described perfectly, will shop again!!!!",1
They are batteries people! They make things work for awhile.,1
Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!,1
Seem to work fone for a fraction of the price!,1
Great tablet for ages 8 and under my kids love them,1
Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn't slow.,1
they seemed to not last as long as other name brand names disappointed!,1
Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!,0
Its a sturdy and great device.Only drawback i can think of is non availability of pure android and a VGA camera.However it works really good for daily use,1
Amazon Basic batteries perform great. My sons game computer goes through batteries so the price of these and there longevity is great.,1
bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for,1
NOT REALLY NEEDED. I ALREADY HAD TWO AND DECIDED THREE WAS OVERLY ONE TOO MUCH.,0
"Love this tablet, great value, come with great protective case, preloaded apps are an awesome feature. The included 2 year protection is also a plus.",1
So much better than the original one I had. I would definitely buy another one.,1
Bought two as gift to kids. They love it very much,1
This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them.,1
"Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy.",1
Is good price . and fast shipping,1
"I bought these batteries as back ups. I normally use rechargeable AA Batteries. I got tired of being the only person in my house to recharge batteries as soon as they die and of people taking my charged batteries out of my controller. I only ordered an 8 pack and have had to use them in a dvd remote, my controller and two thermostats (yep, they both decided to die on me at the same time). I can't tell a difference between these AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries and the name brand ones I normally buy. For the price these are pretty good batteries.",1
Great steelbook for a great movie. this steelbook is amazing,1
This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.,1
Item exactly as described! Fast Shipping!,1
Great price for all the batteries!,1
The package just arrived and all seems well. I have no information on the life of these batteries. If they do well I would be glad to give them 5 stars.,1
Amazon Basics batteries work as good as any of the others.,1
Great performance great price.,1
My son loves this tablet built tough and sturdy at great price,1
Works great what more can I say. Several months in the mouse so far,1
Omg this product is excelent good batery and HD screen love this,1
works like they're supposed to. They're AAA Batteries after all. Either they work or they don't. Makes it convenient to order them online than having to remember if you grabbed them from the store.,1
This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.,1
"Very pleased with these. I haven't used any yet, but for the price and knowing Amazon put their name on these make me think they will be a great battery.",1
In use and functioning per expectations.,1
"I love stocking up on batteries at this price. Amazon, you've done a great job supplying the masses with inexpensive batteries",1
It's a durable tablet geared for younger kids. They can download games for their age level.,1
My three year old son love it. He can read and learn so much from the free time app.,1
"great price, they always have worked for me, my second order, at least",1
"This is a great kindle for smaller children. My 4 year old has already dropped it several times, with no issues. Easy for him to work and comes with kindle free time, which has a lot of educational games.",1
YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT,1
The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.,0
Easy to use. Takes great pictures. Child friendly.,1
Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips,1
These are just as good as Duracell or Energizer.,1
Long life,1
works good so far. just started using them.,1
I only buy batteries from Amazon. Love the Duracell Procell deals but the Amazon branded batteries seem just as good. No way can I score these deals locally.,1
great deal.. fast shipping!!!,1
Always in need of batteries,1
You can buy these at a good price and they seem to last as well as any of the big brands. So I will continue to buy these batteries.,1
great deal!,1
"First time I've ever purchased Amazon Basic batteries, and I am quite pleased with how long they last!",1
"Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price.",1
Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.,-1
very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality,1
Yea. Batteries. What can ya say. Ya can't miss with AmazonBasics.,1
Better performance than I expected. I feel like I get just as much out of these as the name brands and the price is fantastic. Highly recommend!,1
"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!",1
Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.,1
"Works great so far, only small gripe is they stink (like paint thinner). Weird yes I know, but nonetheless they work and that's all that counts!",1
"I usually buy the 5.00 24 battery special at Harbor Freight, but they were not on sale when I needed some, so I decided to get theseBoth of the batteries are supposed to be Alkaline, so you would think they would both last about the same length of time NO SOI use these in a Personal Pedi Callused Skin grinder, so they get a good workoutAMAZON's batteries just don't last as long.... and it's a NOTICEABLE differenceI'm going back to Harbor Freight's Alkaline's",-1
"this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it.",1
I personally think that these batteries are as good as name brand ones for half the price! I primarily use these in my xbox one controllers and change batteries maybe twice a month of heavy play. Definitely worth the purchase!,1
"Definitely Batteries, Definitely AAA! Work great! Great Price!",1
"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them.",-1
"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand",-1
It was easy to set up. My grandson has enjoyed the broad selection of activities from which to choose.,1
I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read,1
Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows.,1
Great,1
Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features,1
"seems to not last very long, curious.",0
seem to work well,1
"Love this for my youngest. He had a Nabi, but it just wasn't as user friendly as this is.",1
Bought several times and they last,1
This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing.,1
I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.,1
The tablet is a perfect tablet and the price is perfect.,1
All good,1
The graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected!,1
Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.,0
I got this for my mom as a gift and she loved it. Great gift,1
It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped,0
These have lasted longer than some other brands. Definitely keeping these stocked up!!,1
Great so far. Let's see how long they last.,1
Great value for the money.,1
"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization.",1
Absolutely perfect case for a near-perfect phone. This case fits perfectly.After a few days of use you'll forget you have a case on the phone.The phone's smooth rounded edges make it near impossible not to drop the phone occasionally. This case is a must for the LG v20.The quality of this case is the best I have ever seen in a smartphone case.Well done!,1
"Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already...",1
Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!!,1
Best thing I got my kids. They don't ask to borrow mine anymore.,1
"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts...",1
Great bargain.,1
Really 48 aa batteries for just over ten bucks. What a great deal,1
Great tablet for my 3 year old son. I am able to monitor his screen time and assure that he is only playing kid friendly and educational games.,1
use in various products last some time arrived on time no damage,1
I bought it for my son for Christmas. I love it. It's much bigger and sturdier than the other Kindle Fires. The font is bigger and much easier to read. It also holds a charge well.,1
"We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range.",1
This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!,1
"What can I say... I need them, they work, and they're less expensive.",1
"Great batteries at a reasonable price. These seem to last as long if not longer than your other name brands. I use these in toys, remote controls and other devices around the house, and haven't had any issues at all.",1
Great find. Will definitely only buy here!,1
great tablet for kids with amazon bonuses. don't have to worry about what content my kid is accessing.,1
"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old.",1
"Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!",1
"This is a great tablet for kids. It has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. There are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read.",1
My grand daughter loved it. She plays with it all the time.,1
"The more I use this, the more reasons I enjoy it. The staff were great and helped me set it up.",1
Very nice quality product. East to set up and use.,1
Good Batteries.,1
Great tablet for the money. Nice screen size allows me to watch movies on it.,1
Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.,1
We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.,1
"Tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent.",1
Price is right. So far so good for quality!,1
This is a great little tablet to carry around. Love that it is easy on my eyes and has very clear picture.,1
"Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one.",1
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle,1
They lasted less than 24 hours in my mouse and that includes turning the mouse off overnight! What a ripoff.,-1
Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.,1
"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that.",1
This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.,1
My 4 year old loves it. I love that she can use it unsupervised without worry. She has been learning her alphabet and this has been a great tool.,1
"We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids.",1
I bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves the games and camera. Works great. Glad I got it for her.,1
What can I say. There batteries.,1
"I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games.",1
"Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games.",1
Wish it didn't have all of the apps on the home page,1
This kindle does everything i want and more. No regrets on the purchase,1
Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........,0
"I seriously don't think I will buy these from the store ever again. These are half the price, and work well in all of my electronics.",1
Great product,1
Good deal from Black Friday sales and will make a very good Christmas gift. Kids edition excellent with the rubber bumper case which provides pretty good protection.,1
I like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one has to clear before one gets to the main screen. Other than that the battery lasts a long time and its compact and easy to use.,1
I bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves the games and camera. Works great. Glad I got it for her.,1
"New Kindle Fire 8 is easy to setup, great for reading, no issues at all when trying to connect to my home network. I would recommend this item for anyone who wants to read and get on the internet.",1
My wife loves this product. She loves playing games on it.,1
I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use,1
I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.,0
"Bought this for my 4yo daughter for Christmas and it's a sturdy little unit. It survived falls and drops but the one weak spot is the USB power plug, somehow my daughter managed to break it. However this is where Amazon stepped up as the tablet's warranty calls for Amazon to replace if damaged. I called customer service, they took my info and I had a brand new tablet deliver the next day!",1
"Good price, work fine.",1
Great batteries and amazing cost I also love how they come packaged easy to store away and use when needed! Thanks Amazon!!,1
Great tablet great screen built well responds well,1
Good quality,1
Easy to use at home or lunch at the office. The only problem I have is that you have to restart often. Great while using public transportation.,1
"Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids,",1
"Was a perfect purchase to get her as she was getting tired of looking at stuff on her small phone screen, just a basic android tablet that has the benefits of others and at a really great price on black friday.",1
Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle,1
You couldn't get a better buy for $59 than the Amazon fire 7. Paid the extra $20 to get the 16gb. Well worth it.,1
My son loved his amazon fire HD 8 great for game and books to read,1
I love these batteries. I am so happy that I bought them. Batteries are super expensive at my local retailer. It's sad when the batteries cost more than the thing you are putting them into. I paid about the same amount to get 48... Yes 48 AA batteries from Amazon as I would have paid to get 8 from my local retailer. I needed batteries for my new game trail camera. It takes 8 AA batteries and I was fearful that I was going to go into the poor house trying to keep fresh batteries in my trail camera. I went shopping online at Amazon and found these. I bought these several weeks ago. I used 8 AA from this box in my new trail camera. I am so happy with them. My trail camera has been in the woods several weeks and the batteries are still over 90 charged and that's after taking tons of video of game. These are working great and I saved a ton of cash. I am buying a box of the AAA now. I always seem to need them around the house for some reason. I am very happy with my new batteries from AmazonBasics. They are working great for me. I hope you found this information useful to you and thank you for reading.If you found this information helpful please click Yes on the link below. I greatly appreciate it.,1
I have purchased Amazon batteries before and they last as long as the leading brands like Energizer or Duracell's for 3x less the cost. Most people nowadays are using rechargeable but there are a few things that still require Alkaline such as my temp signal transmitter for my digital clocks and a pair of these lasted about 9 months out in weather. Other brands died within a few months. You will not be disappointed.,1
Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet,1
Worked on an android phone on a recent trip when a friend forgot their charger. Works great on my Kindle Fire as well ! Just what I needed!,1
"This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her.",1
"The batteries appear to be working great. I've been using two AA's in my Xbox One controller for over a month now. If you can get a sale on these like I did, buy, buy, buy!",1
These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.,-1
"I really love this tablet for my toddler! The only things I have against it are that there is no kickstand on it, it may lag at times, and there is no way to lock the screen so the movie can't be exited. Other than that it's a great tablet.",1
Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.,1
I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.,1
"Aside from the fact that the saleman told me that the tablet would be able to get all the same apps that an Android tablet would be able to get from the playstore, which was hilariously wrong, this product would never connect to the internet correctly. I had to reset the internet every single time on the table for my son to use it, starting from day one and up. My son loved having the electric device and I didn't take it back for those reasons, but now 60 days out, the thing doesn't even charge anymore and I'm having to take it back in. At least I bought the warrenty, because this is literally a huge waste of money. I'd rather have spent $500 on a different tablet than this garbage.",-1
The size and price makes this a best buy! I'm very pleased with my tablet,1
We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.,1
"Sorry to say these batteries leaked in a lighted mirror and ruined it. C'mon, Amazon!",-1
Sweet deal! :),1
best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had,1
The batteries work great thank you for the order will be ordering more soon.,1
Works ok. Doesn't last too long,1
Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!,1
Bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken.great,1
There were 2 batteries missing from the pack. Just annoying enough to write a bad review. Not annoying enough to do anything else about it...,-1
Gift for my wife to listen to her music when she's sewing plus being able to purchase supplies as she runs out.,1
"My 3yo is quite rough with stuff, as most are. And the case that comes with it is great!!",1
My girls love the tablet. It has lots of apps they can download. The only problem the battery is used up even when not in use.,1
Have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well.,1
"I've kept a stock of these batteries for about a year (in a drawer in my living room) and used them in my air freshener with no problems. However, when I used them with my Pawbo toy (it's a remote cat toy), not only do they not last very long, but I just went to replace the batteries and saw that were leaking after only a day!",-1
Two thumbs up,1
Purchased as an X-mas gift for my 5 y/o son and he definitely loves this tablet. Great built-in parental controls that enable us to control daily usage time and content.,1
Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product.,1
Nice device I like to use it to read books online.,1
Great product. Love using it for reading and search.,1
These batteries do not last long at all as compared to Energizer. After 4 days of use they were no good anymore. The Energizer batteries have last me two weeks so far when using for the same thing. I will be using far more batteries so it really isn't a money saver. Disappointed!,-1
Died almost immediately. Ruined their purpose for the purpose needed.,-1
I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.,1
Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.,1
"I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you.",1
I got this tablet for my 3 year old granddaughter. She enjoys it and it keeps her busy and learning. Everything rolled into one for her.,1
"The only way to buy batteries. Large quantity, and great price.",1
I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.,1
Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants.,1
Great price,1
We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.,1
"Got this for my nephew, he loves it. Downloaded a ton of content and still super quick. However the cameras are AWFUL!!!!",1
"We bought this tablet for our 6 year old son for Christmas. It has so many great features and love the warranty....if they break it, they'll replace it!",1
"This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn't need it and probably wouldn't use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can't live without a kindle.",1
This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.,1
It's an excellent learning tablet for a child. I would recommend that every parent that has a small child to get one.,1
"Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100",1
These batteries do not come close to duracel in terms of longevity.,-1
Great batteries at an even greater price. Mucho Grassyass.,1
trying them out. so far so good,1
Better than expected for Amazon brand batteries,1
Work just as well as any other batteries and are cheaper!,1
A+,1
performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars,1
My son requested this a a birthday gift. He is enjoying it everyday.,1
I bought these for my wireless Apple mouse and keyboard that eat through batteries quick. They seem to last me just as long as Energizer and Duracell AA batteries at a fraction of the cost.,1
Good price. Good product. Nothing to complain about this. Will probably continue buying these if the price remains the same or within a reasonable range.,1
Great Value!,1
"Great price on necessary item, seems to have environmentally friendly packaging. They are easy to store, as the box is flat and about the size of a small book. Performance of the batteries has been unremarkable, I don't have a sense that they last longer or shorter than any others and I've no convenient way to assess that. I'd prefer a built-in battery-life indicator, but that would surely increase the price, and I can just use a battery tester. I noticed that a favorite YouTube tech reviewer Linus Sebastian uses them, and he's a frugal fellow that reassures me that I made a good choice. I recommend them.",1
"They work not bad , but these batteries does not work in some devices, I do not know why This is why I dropped one star off.",1
That's crap,-1
Great value!,1
Good tablet with easy functionality. Size makes it easily portable.,1
Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!,1
Great batteries! High quality. And so many of them! Have not had to replace any of them yet. I'm battery rich!,1
less expensive than most and lasts just as long,1
Good batteries. Good price,1
Great tablet for kids they love it it is also great that you can download music and movies through Amazon Prime,1
"Works as expected, and good value for money as batteries seem to be so expensive these days.",1
Works great!,1
Got these for some LED motion lights. So fare working great.,1
Good cheap batteries,1
work good,1
No issues thus far. I just started using them so I speak for their longevity.,1
These batteries work and last good.,1
I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books.,1
"It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps",1
Got it for our grandson for Christmas and he won't put it down. Comes with free kids software which is great.,1
Why spend more when you can have the same quaility,1
Another great offer from Amazon that delivers perfarmance and price for your electronic agenda 1,1
I bought this and onother color at the same time. Great item no complaint,1
"They're batteries, they work. I'll post about it I see they don't last very long, but I've gained a lot of trust in Amazon brand products so I'm fairly confident.",1
This is the best thing for reading specially on the go.,1
THIS PRODUCT IS FANTASTIC,1
Great app selection. Parental controls are easy to set up to prevent unwanted purchases. The fact that the bumper is already included is a plus and protects it well.,1
These batteries don't seem to last as long as other brands.,-1
bought this for my grandson as i had bought one a year before for my other grandson. Great for younger ones,1
"So far, so good. They all seem fully charged and last as expected.",1
It is a great buy. Nice quality.Enjoy playing music and emailing at the sametime.,1
Great Stuff I like the way you guys packed it great job,1
They work. What more could I say.,1
Super!,1
Great value,1
Batteries work as listed.,1
"No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,",1
Great deal!,1
"This Kindle has no extra bells or whistles that would cause major battery drainage. Sometimes less is more. No distractions to keep you from reading, no backlights to fatigue your eyes. Be aware that you can't read this Kindle in the dark.Pretty simple to operate. FYI there is no wall plug adapter for this unit only the USB cord that plugs into the Kindle, and computer for charging. You can buy an adapter separately. If you have the Kindle Fire HDX that adapter works with this kindle. You can use that adapter to charge it from the electrical outlet.I recently purchased this Kindle. I do have had other Kindles, and enjoy them immensely.I purchased this one for outdoor use.So far I Love it!",1
"Good price, last long!",1
"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad",1
I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great,1
Ergonomic and easy to get new books. My house is full of books and I need to quit stockpiling them. And I can't remember what I read years ago. This device helps.,1
My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...,1
"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine.",0
"Good or better than Durcell at much less cost. Made in Indonesia, not China.",1
I use these in my Bluetooth gaming chair's transmitter that uses 2 AAA's. Approximate battery life is 50+ hours. Incredible!,1
Love item for 2 year old,1
I purchased this for raffle prizes and they're great for the price.,1
"So far they're holding up just like the brand name versions, but they're much cheaper.",1
They are good like any other batteries and the price is good.,1
Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids,1
Great for small children allows for limited time setting. Also allows parents to set a requirement for how long educational apps must be used before free time. Case works well,1
Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool.,1
last long enough for toys i suppose,1
Purchased these for Christmas gifts. Assuming they were satisfactory because I didn't hear of need for returning. Purchased as angel tree gifts for preteens.,1
"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for.",1
Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.,1
This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it,1
Haven't used them long so I'm not sure how long they last. So far happy with purchase. Will continue to use. Great prices.,1
Love these BUT 2 of the 4 packages were NIT warm lights. They are really super bright cold white. Can't use them.,0
Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it.,1
such a great value for great batteries. i love amazon basic products.,1
Great product and good customer services. The person I met in the store explained me all the features.,1
"I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat.",1
bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime,1
The product is very durable and is great for children,1
These are fantastic and arrived quickly.,1
"Great batteries. Very strong, and last as long as anything else out there.",1
Better than older kindles. Reading a book on a kindle is easier than holding a book.,1
The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors.,1
"Works well my little loves it,battery life great..",1
You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.,1
"This has been a very nice addition, it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it.",1
Just as good as Duracells for a fraction of the price.,1
Purchased these for our grandchildren ... great for children learning to use electronics.,1
Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.,1
My son loves it. The picture and quality is great and my so loves all the apps from the characters he loves,1
Works well. Good battery life. Great savings.,1
This is a good product for your money. It's basic it does the job.,1
"So we gave it to my 1yr old for christmas, on the box it says if you break any way theyll replace, 30sec after opening he throws it down and jumps on .... works great lol loves watching spongbob on lol",1
Batteries did not last more than two days,-1
I tried recharging them right out of the box and it says they are bad! I'll by my rechargeables elsewhere,-1
Work great!,1
Work good,1
My son loves his own kindle! Very kid friendly and easy for him to use. It is great that he now has his own!,1
A++++,1
"So far, so good. They are what they are supposed to be. I will check back after using and see if they have long life. BTW, packaging is very good.",1
"Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness.",1
"Good, fast and responsive. The price is also very reasonable. Great for what I need this tablet for. I use it to stream music to my soundbar.",1
"Great, non-expensive item for my kids to us and not destroy my Ipad.",1
"These batteries are high quality and inexpensive. I bought this pack to primarily use in toys like nerf guns. I was slightly concerned about buying a brand that I had never used before especially for a birthday party (even if it has Amazon's name on it).When I opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised. They have a decent weight to them. This is generally how you can tell the difference between cheap batteries and high-quality batteries. The heavier they are the liner they will last.After using these batteries for a Nerf battle birthday party to power large Nerf guns and throughout Christmas, I'm hooked. I have enrolled in a Subscribe and Save plan on Amazon which allows for an additional discount to have them delivered periodically.I would definitely recommend these batteries to anyone for whatever battery needs they may have. They are high- quality, inexpensive, Amazon.com backed batteries. There really isn't much of a risk.",1
"Although the price is high, it is worth and useful.",1
Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better,1
One of the best tablets on the market for its value,1
"I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube.",1
I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it.,1
Just fine.,1
"Dude. These lights are so amazing! They are the perfect addition underneath our kitchen cabinets. I really love the remote, which allows you to not only dim the lights, but it also has a timer! The individual lights came with two small screws to install, as well as 3M tape. We used the screws for a more durable effect. The lights also came with brand new batteries in them to get you started! As an interior decorator and stager, I'll tell my clients about these. Great product!",1
This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it.,1
Works and performs just as long as other name brands. Great price for the number of batteries int he pack. Would recommend.,1
They work great used all of them in 2 min on all my Kids GEOtrax trains.,1
"This tablet has served it's purpose, it keeps my little one entertained with age appropriate sites and apps.",1
Very nice and easy to use and the kindle is great.,1
My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it,1
Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.,-1
"made my day or as life goes on, I won't have to worry about batteries. and at a good price.",1
"I have not yet determined the useful life of these when in use. I installed four in my camera last week. I just do not know how long they will last, but they look good",1
I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.,1
Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it,1
These don't last long at all.,-1
Bought these for all the grandkids for Christmas. Basic enough for a 10 year old but with enough features and capability for the 18 year old!,1
"Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs!",1
My son uses this all the time. Very easy to use and for him to learn educationally.,1
"Love Amazon Batteries there just awesome, after all its a battery and its seems to last a long time",1
"The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great.",1
They do the job. Nicely packaged too!,1
This is a great little kids tablet. Has a lot of features and is really fun to use.,1
"Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50.",0
"Excellent power and price. You can't beat this deal on high quality batteries. Even the club warehouse prices for their own store brands are more expensive than these.They provide more than adequate power for everything we've used them for.They work very good for small flashlights too.Seriously. You are not going to find a better deal for high quality, reliable alkaline batteries anywhere.",1
Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it,1
"Great product, for a very good price! Loved this tablet",1
Great for travel when you want to read in vacation.,1
Great product,1
Product seems to be as advertised.,1
I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.,1
I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my flameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. None of those worked either So I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don't understand.,-1
It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!,1
Great value!!,1
"This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I'm stuck on my Kindle.",1
So far so good. Haven't had long enough to say if they last long or not. Liked price and the amount in package.,1
"Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!",1
This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do.,1
Entirely satisfied with the batteries and their price.,1
as good as duracells,1
Bulk is always the less expensive way to go for products like these,1
"Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100",1
Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.,1
Great batteries for very reasonable price. What more could you ask,1
"Bought these for our camping trip to use in lanterns. Lasted just as long, if not longer than name branded ones.",1
So far so good,1
"My daughter loves this. She uses it for both games and educational apps, as well as listen to music.",1
OK,1
Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use,1
"I purchased this table to use to check my email and get on Facebook, but I use it for so much more. It is a great tablet for a good price.",1
My son love it. He always play using this and no problem at all.,1
"This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to.",1
Works like a charm-m-m,1
My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.,1
Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.,1
This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.,1
No problems!,1
"Work well so far, but cannot tell yet long term",1
I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included.,1
Great price for this quantity of batteries. Seem to work just fine for all of my needs.,1
"Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small.",1
great value and last a long time,1
My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...,1
The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon,1
"Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well...",1
PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS.,1
"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure.",0
GReat,1
Purchased this over the holidays and have enjoyed it since. The look and feel of a book is great.,1
"seems just as good as higher-priced batteries. I have had good experience with an AmazonBasics wireless mouse I've been using for 1 1/2 years, and the reviews for these batteries are excellent. For the price, I am fully satisfied.",1
Good batteries at a good price,1
"My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price.",1
This size holds more apps and content. It's pretty lightweight too.,1
"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful.",0
So far these have held up well against the more expensive brands.,1
Got one for my 4yr old. She loves it. It's very durable. I love that I can switch accounts and use it for myself too.,1
These batteries are a great bargain. I bought these for my mother's blood pressure machine which gobbles them up. They last just as long as the name brands that she had been using.,1
"Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother's Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games.",1
This is my second kindle fire. The 6th gen is an even better experience. Glad I preordered.,1
works as expected,1
Great product love the auto adjusting black lightLove the weight of the kindle light enough I can hold it with one hand an turn the pages,1
Limited time by Mom but she says he loves it a lot,1
"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch.",1
"I bought this tablet for my three year old niece. It was easy to set up for her, and she loves it. I also purchased the Kids Free case, to protect it.",1
In support of the snmap circuits - I was very happy with this purchase for my 9 year old grandchild who loves electroniucs and uising his hands,1
make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.,1
This Fire worked great but I returned it because it was not the one I wantedBest Buy took it back for a full refund with no problems Best Buy is alsome,1
Amazon Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though.,1
Good buy,1
I shopped for a long time until I found this and I am very pleased.,1
Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.,1
I will probably never buy batteries anywhere but here again. My husband is a gamer and typically blows through all kinds of batteries but these do the trick. I havent noticed them needing replacement any more frequent then other major brands like duracell or energizer,1
"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift.",1
Nice quality and friendly packaging... besides a great price :),1
Bought a couple for my kids for xmass and they love them.,1
I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account.,1
A+++++,1
I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.,0
This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended.,1
My daughter loves her tablet because she can carry it to all places,1
This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it.,1
Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.,1
"Awesome price, awesome batteries. I will never buy batteries anywhere else again, this deal is hard to beat.",1
"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy.",1
I love it. I‚Äôm so glade they made this tablet with protection. Love that my child can watch movies learn and play kid games.,1
"Seemed to be fine as Chtistmas gift for granddaughter. However, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. Supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. Don't know where to take it.",-1
This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.,1
"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it.",1
Absolutely love my new Kindle Voyager. Lightweight and compact size makes it easier to carry with me everywhere I go. Wish I had bought one sooner.,1
"My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!",1
cheap and work gritty good,1
Work great and are a great price. Can't beat that! These seem to be on par with low to mid tier brand battery live so can't complain.,1
Love it works great a lot of fun great for listening to music,1
there's a lot and they work. what else can I say except they got here fast.,1
Tablet met all her needs! She loves it! Great purchase,1
This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped.,1
My niece loves this tablet! She will not put it down!,1
pleased!,1
"My children loved it, and it is great learning tool.",1
just what I needed,1
"Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Xbox remote. The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them 3x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more.",-1
Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.,1
The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.,1
"I'm appreciative of those reviewers who have actually tested the voltage of these batteries, which definitely impacted me in buying them. I primarily bought these because they are cheap. I've got a handful of wireless keyboards/mice that use AA batteries and go through them pretty quickly. The batteries came easily packaged (in 4's within a box) and they work as described. I don't store batteries for long periods of time so I don't think I'll ever (possibly) encountering leaking issues.",1
Great product! I will recommend this to all of my family and friends.,1
Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate.,1
These are good batteries. How do I know. I installed these in my electric tooth brush 2 months ago. The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.,1
So convenient to purchase these online.,1
"Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong.",1
I love it when Amazon brings out commonly used products under their own name that perform well and are priced right. These AAA batteries are just another example of Amazon's buying power and smart branding. Because why would any company put their name (and reputation) on a product if they weren't convinced that it would be a true value to consumers The last thing that they want consumers to do is identify Amazon with anything but quality.So buy these knowing that they are a good value and work properly. And if for some reason you get a bad batch--which can happen to anyone--simply return them under their return policy and get a replacement box.,1
Exactly as described!,1
This tablet is good for beginners and immediate use. The picture and processor is great. Let‚Äôs not forget this is a amazon product.,1
great batteries! Will never buy another brand again!,1
Got this as a gift for friend of mine they have been very happy with this can't believe how light it is and how well you can read the text. If you're up for him and don't want to be caring around an iPad or have battery life on the product while you're on location this is a must take with you product.,1
good price for the battery package.,1
I bought this for my step mom who likes playing solitaire. She wore her hand held game out and couldn't find a replacement. She just loves it and can do a lot of other things on it.,1
EXCELLENT,1
This is a great tablet for the price I paid. My husband loves it!,1
"I have been wanting to get a tablet for my grandson. However his mother insisted on waiting till he was older. Recently he has been talking a lot more and my daughter said that if I wanted to buy the kids kindle for him. Its a great tool since he has the kindle unlimited free time he has learnered shapes, basic colors, words, puzzles, numbers, sorting, and even sequencing. Money well spent my grandson loves it.",1
Very long lasting batteries for a great price,1
I wanted something for reading and surfing the web and i love it.,1
"good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time",1
"I will never purchase batteries online ever again! I should have never believed that this is Unique Japanese technology that enables better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures, because frankly IT DID NOT EVEN LAST FOR TWO DAYS FOR MY DIGITAL CLOCK THAT HAS FOUR PLACEMENTS OF AAA BATTERIES. At first I believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries, no problem, THEN, a week and a half has passed and I had to change the batteries for my clock FIVE TIMES! I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, but it is frustrating to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product. Well that's that, have a good one!",-1
Great seal for batteries,1
works perfectly... not much else to say. they are AA batteries,1
For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.,1
"This is a good tablet for internet, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu and email. Only complaints are the locked screen wallpaper is an ad and the screen is not as bright as an iPad but a winner for the price.",1
the charge holds a bit,1
power-full,1
"purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it.",1
"Bargain, inexpensive",1
Batteries. What else can i say,1
"works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle",1
Good tablet for kids. Easy to use and kid friendly,1
This is the best priced device that I found with the most functionality. Amazing black Friday deal!!!,1
Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price!,1
"good condition when they arrived and already have some installed and being used, working great.",1
"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)",1
Great product ....glade i bought the bundle ...,1
Great batteries for the price.,1
"It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear...",1
its a great great gift that can be used by everyone,1
as adv,1
"They are batteries, they are cheap, and they work. Most research shows there is no significant difference between alkaline batteries, no matter what the brand. Buy these, save yourself some money. You won't be disappointed.",1
bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn't go anywhere without my kindle!,1
I love AmazonBasics batteries. Great price and quality.,1
"I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around.",1
Good deal,1
This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you!,1
Love this tablet! It's easy to setup and the pre-loaded games were a hit with my little one! Very pleased with the the selection of videos and games on Amazon Kid Play :),1
This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.,1
"for the price you cant beat this, my daughter loves it and wont put it down and the protective case def helps when it is dropped trust me , cannot go wrong with a kindle for this price",1
"I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself.",1
For the money this tablet has a great display and allows you to do pretty much the same that lots of other more expensive devices are capable of.,1
No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally.,1
I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.,1
My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.,1
"So impressed with the battery life on this! My phone's battery is almost dead in the morning, but this thing can play music for 8 hours and the battery just goes down 20%. :)",1
Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet,1
Great that you can add micro SD card for expanded memory. Works great for around the house and long trips. Battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.,1
This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.,0
"I bought two of these as a birthday gift for my niece and nephew. They absolutely love them. They use it all the time to play games and music. Great deal, great price LOVE ITL:)",1
"good batteries for the price, no better deal around",1
great batteries. They work well especially to have as emergency backups. My previous kit lasted a good long time. I usually just use rechargeable batteries but it's good to have some standard's around as well just in case,1
This is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass),1
did order or get,-1
Nice tablet for a kid or teenager no allot of memory.,1
I'm very happy with this tablet..My nephew loves it.,1
If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality,1
48 batterys for only 15 Very good deal!!! Nice batterys also work perfectly.,1
Bad shelf life. No where near Duracell. For very light duty only.,-1
Best batery,1
"This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet.",1
We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.,1
Great batteries. They last a good while.,1
I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device.,1
I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.,1
These seem to work out well for me. Battery checker device confirms full charge when they arrive and they last in my electronics an expected about of time. I have continued to buy and have been satisfied. They seem fresher that the store bought equivalents,1
Good buy,1
I really love this tablet it is a pretty good size and it has a good amount of internal memory and has been able to do everything I have wanted it to do this far,1
Quality batteries at a great price.,1
Work like it should.,1
This was my second e reader and I love it easy to operate along with a lot of apps available.,1
I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it.,1
Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again.,1
Gift for our son and he is really enjoying it. He can read as well as play games.,1
These batteries have been performing wonderfully in my clocks and other small appliances. The price is right with Subscribe and Save and I can't beat the quality or price elsewhere. They come nicely packed and shrink wrapped in four packs making them easy to carry. I will definitely continue to purchase.,1
Biggest bang for your buck.,1
Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!,1
So far so good!,1
and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.,1
Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.,-1
Very good batteries,1
I like the price but haven't had them long enough to rate them on how long they will last.,1
"Am amazed at how well I'm loving your batteries, Amazom. I have been a loyal Duracell buyer, but find yours are not cost way less, but last longer. Would give them 10 stars if you allowed me.",1
"Okay; we know this is not an iPad so the horsepower is limited but at the $80 price point ($50 on sale as I write this and as I purchased it), it's a fantastic bargain.Don't let any reviews here claim that you can't run most Android apps (including the Google Play Store and its apps!). You just have to be a little crafty. Follow the instructions here: http://saintlad.com/install-google-play-store-on-kindle-fire/ ...and in 15 minutes, I had the Play Store, Play Books (which means all of the books I had uploaded there now were available on the Kindle). Sure, you can use Amazon's servicesKindle books, videos, buying stuff on Amazonbut you don't -have- to. Note that this unit has the lockscreen ads which, frankly, you see only for 2 seconds before you unlock it; so don't waste your money thinking you have to pay more for the non-ad version. Web surfing isn't as fast as on my iPad but it's fine, really. (And I'm a Mac person.)",1
My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained,1
"Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights.",1
May grandson loves this. Went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained.,1
easy to use plenty of space for a kid recommend warranty,1
I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.,1
I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.,1
Great batteries,1
I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.,1
Bought for my eight year old. She absolutely loves it!,1
Came on time and in one piece. Haven't noticed a difference in quality between these batteries and any other name brand.,1
These batteries have been working great for us so far. Excellent for all of todays modern Christmas and Birthday Presents.,1
"I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)",1
:),1
"The new Kindle Voyage is quite a step forward for the Kindle dedicated reader line. It is a beautiful device - almost like something from Apple. I like the lighted screen and the page forward and back ""buttons"" on the sides of the device. But it is rather pricey - not yet convinced it is worth the upcharge.",1
"So far, so good, but I've only used it for 1 week. Would've like for some kind of handle for the cover so it's easier to hold for kids small hands.",1
Good batteries for my Christmas lights. I like the fact that I can recycle them after they run out.,1
My son absolutely loves this tablet. He has dropped it a lot and hasn't cracked it yet but even if he did amazon would replace it for up to two years for free. I also like the prime account for the kids to be able to play whatever apps for free,1
Got this for my nephew. Easy for him to use. Easy setup.,1
Batteries,1
Much better quality than the Eveready batteries I normally purchase at a discount store. My telephone headset eats through batteries which is why I don't like to spend too much on them - the first time I used these batteries they outlasted them!,1
Great value!,1
None of first eight batteries I opened worked. Tested other batteries to confirm was a battery problem. Confirmed!!!Wow.,-1
"I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids.",1
"I really like it, it's working out quite well for me wish I had bought one a lot sooner",1
"This tablet is great for kids. I love all the different kids content available. The only negative thing I have noticed so far is that at time it will freeze up and I end up having to reboot to fix it. So far, that's the only issue.",1
Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.,1
"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle.",1
When using these batteries in a professional camera flash (high powered device) they last only 3/4 as long as a similar duracell or energizer battery but for the difference in price I recommend these. In something like an xbox controller (low power device) they seem to last just as long.,1
Works great and have not had any issues. The case is great for younger kids,1
A great deal on batteries,1
This is not what I received.,-1
"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it.",-1
Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.,1
Appear to perform as well as top-brand batteries at a fraction of the price. The storage box they come in fits nicely in our utility drawer.,1
My kids love this product it keeps them busy anytime of day,1
"My kids like it, and the application is amazing.I recommend it for all kids",1
Works well.,1
I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.,1
Worked fine,1
Bought for my eight year old. She absolutely loves it!,1
Seem to work well.,1
We are always needing batteries these work great i wll defintiely be ordering them again,1
We have the tap and the echo. I wouldn't buy another tap. It's the voice activation that is so good. But if you don't mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok. But for me... only echo.,1
Great product for the price. It is not a high end tablet but great for browsing and reading,1
just as good as duracell,1
Purchased this for my son. Decent tablet but not optimum,1
I purchased this for my 12 year old and it was at a great price point. I like the parental controls feature with the multiple profiles. This allows me to control what she has access to which is a plus for me.,1
These are great batteries at a great price. Enough said,1
Awesome product for kids who are looking to learn more,1
They're batteries,0
"Awesome value for the price, works great.",1
Great way to get kids introduced to using a tablet. A ton of free software is available. Guarantee seals the deal.,1
"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet.",1
"This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!",1
Easy to open and use.,1
"AMAZING DEAL!!!So many batteries for an amazing price!!! In the stores, you get half the amount of batteries for double the price.100 will re buy.work great. FAST SHIPPING TO! (ONLY TOOK A DAY)",1
it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done.,1
Nice size and color. It was easy to grip. very pleased,1
They are batteries.,1
I got this for my one and two year old girls and I don't have any complaints! The battery life isn't great but I don't really mind that!,1
My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.,1
Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew for his birthday. He had been asking for a tablet forever. I made his day! He loves his tablet. All he's does is watch you tube and play games,1
"I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail about these batteries. Other reviewers here have done a fantastic job of doing that. Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it.",1
still working fine,1
Bought this tablet to read books and it also has other good qualities.,1
Great batteries with an even better price!,1
I bought these for my Xbox one remotes because the other brands I would buy dies way too quickly. I was a little skeptical at first because I had never heard of Amazon Basics but I'm glad I tried them. I play the Xbox everyday and the batteries have not died within three weeks. That's great quality.,1
"Great dealgreat deal, not sure how the life of the battery.",1
"For start it is a good running tablet for price, does what i need it for!!",1
"About 1/3 the price of anything in Wal-Mart. With 3 kids, we use a lot of batteries.",1
Great price! Batteries work great. I'm happy that I bought in bulk because I saved money and now I'm not constantly searching for batteries.,1
On point,1
Excelent choice. I'm just missing the screenshot possibilty.,1
Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch.,1
"Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld.",1
Excellent batteries for the price. Never had a bad battery with them and I've ordered several boxes. Having them packaged in a recloseable box is a nice plus.,1
I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven't bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn't stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too.,1
Superb.,1
Brought this for my daughter and it's been a life saver!!! I love that it already comes with the pink bumper it's perfect for her!! Set up was also a breeze!!! I'm very pleased with this purchase.,1
Always a pleasure to have a near unlimited supply of batteries! Thanks Amazon!,1
Really good working.,1
This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.,1
Wonderful gift for my niece.She gets entertainment and also gets to use it to learn things.,1
"My 3yo is quite rough with stuff, as most are. And the case that comes with it is great!!",1
good deal,1
Great batteries and super cheap for how many you get!,1
"Got a fantastic deal on Black Friday. We have owned iPads for years as well as eReaders. My dad used an older Kindle ereader but never one of the family tablets. Even so, I decided for this deal price to get him his own Kindle Fire, as well as the Fire case and a tempered glass screen protector. I got a 64gb micro sd and set it all up with his books and favorite news sites and apps he would use, and re boxed it up as a gift. Well 5 months have passed and he has not put it down! He loves it! He reads his books, surfs and has become a news hound. Suddenly we have all sorts of political discussions haha - good thing we are on the same page for the most part. It‚Äôs great that he reads so much and has this as a hobby now that he is retired. What a fabulous gift this turned out to be. It‚Äôs pretty easy for him to use even though he was used to Apple devices. He rarely has questions and just loves streaming video to the Chromecast, reading the news and has burned through a lot of novels. No complaints. I highly recommend this for the price, compared to my iPad that cost hundreds more.",1
Yup. Batteries.,1
exactly what i needed,1
Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.,1
its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it.,1
aaa+++,1
"I have many AA battery operated things in my house. I use flameless candles that come on every night and stay on for 6 hours. I go through batteries. It was getting pretty expensive at the store. Found these, ordered them. Using them. They seem to be a high quality battery, unlike some others I have purchased only to have them last half as long. These are great!",1
price was right- works,1
"My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games.",1
"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",0
"These are a fabulous deal, and oh so convenient, especially for baby toys, smoke alarms, and other gadgets.",1
I have done this like 5 times now. Don't send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating.,1
Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use,1
I don't think I can find cheaper Alkaline batteries to be honest. Their life is pretty good too.,1
"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one.",1
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.,0
This deal it very convenient for Little ones all in one set,1
Amazonbasics products are very satisfied with high quality and low price,1
"I purchased on a one day sale for $50, mainly to have an extra tablet laying around for quick access to the web. Found it very useful to work with Amazon shopping and other apps, as well as Alexa/ Screen colorful and sharp, plays movies full screen with only a 2Gbs download wifi connection. Customizing this device has made it much more a true android tablet and so far it's great. Some things still cannot be done vs conventional Android tablets, otherwise would have given 5 stars rather than 4. Highly recommended for the price.",1
"These batteries are lasting as long as my more expensive batteries. I bought them because I needed them for Christmas but, I will get these from now on.",1
Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.,1
I only buy Amazon batteries now! They are just as good as any other brand and way more affordable.,1
I am not a fan of off-brand batteries and so far have been disappointed by off-brand battery performance. I have decided to give these batteries a try and thus far they have performed as expected. At this time I have a number of Amazon batteries because they are low cost.,1
Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.,1
This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.,1
This tablet is perfect for a young child. The case it comes with is wonderful and seems very protective.,1
I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.,1
Cheap Quality Batteries,1
"I have a digital charger that has been very effective at recharging alkaline batteries. I usually get two or three 90 charges from a quality battery before it starts to leak. These are fine for their original life, but none could handle a recharge. Yes, I know that's what all alkaline batteries advertise, but at this price, which is equivalent to what I pay for Maxell and others, I expected a more robust container.",0
Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom!,1
"This Table is good for children because won't break if dropped. However, the only problem I have, as well as other people in the family who bought the same Table, is the charger port that get damaged after first few days of use.",1
Great battery pack at a great price.,1
"The batteries are fine, but the fact it defaults to a subscription sale is rally wrong, IMHO.",1
Works well!,1
"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it.",1
"I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them.",1
This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. I like the Amazon exchange policy if it breaks.,1
Work just as good as name brand!!,1
Very poor batteries. I ordered a box and so far about 50 are either bad out of the box or very soon after.,-1
great product!,1
Bought this for my my daughter. Good for slower games. Kind of slow loading pages and when watching videos,0
Bought 2 for my 7yr old twins. The are great for the little ones but also great for general use.Very responsive.,1
As expected.,1
This was a gift for my niece's birthday. She loves it .Plus the kid safe,1
"Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price.",1
Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.,1
"I have been a strong believer in Amazon batteries for years. If you do not feel like dealing with rechargeables, theirs are definitely the way to go. As good as any national brand in my opinion. Just another reason I love Amazon.",1
"The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process.",1
"I have had a regular black and white Kindle for years and I love it, but i wanted something back lighted to take on vacation and night reading. The Fire is perfect, small and light and easy to use.",1
This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"It has a clear screen, the books are easy to download, I like the other features as well.",1
"Bought this for vacation electronics. Music, magazines, audibles and books in one reasonably priced piece. Didn't worry about my expensive mobile phone and iPad being at the beach or in the car or elements.",1
"Good Batteries, but not as long lasting as the Duracell batteries.",1
My grandson loves this tablet kid friendly .He plays with this all the time .,1
"Durable , worth every penny, got it for our 2 year old daughter , amazed how easily she can navigate it",1
Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday,1
This is an economical set of AA batteries. The batteries have been lasting quite a long time and I'm very happy with them!,1
I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought.,1
"good batteries, they last long time.",1
"My teens needed something they could use to read favorite books, watch movies, edit photos, and catch up with friends on social media. The Kindle Fire 7 tablet covered all this and more at a great price.",1
"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.",1
they do not last like other batteries. i use in candles with timers... i get maybe 2 weeks out of them... 50+ hours.... i use to get months out of my duracell....,-1
So nice having a huge pack of batteries in the house. I never run out. These work super great!,1
great product with good price,1
I brought it for my grandmother and she really loves it.,1
"I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes.",1
I would buy another one for the priceGood product,1
"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die.",-1
"Excellent tablet for a young child that is very durable, expandable, inexpensive and my grand daughter loves it.",1
Works as well with the same time supply in very expensive name brands.,1
MY children love their new Amazon Fire Tablet. Quality picture and sound.,1
"I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas present. She loves it, much better than the old Sony reader she had which had limited books and was much more expensive.",1
"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!",1
BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.,1
"Great product, great price.",1
"Great product, worked as described!",1
AOK,1
"good bargain. haven't had them long enough to determine life, but so far so good!",1
"I also have a Nook Glow but I miss having buttons. The ""squeeze the edge"" for a page turn is what sold me.",1
"These are fine and the price is right. I normally get the box of 48 Maxell batteries and... this is not objective... but I feel like those batteries last longer. Still, these batteries are fine and do what they're intended to do. They're certainly not long-life though.",1
They work.,1
Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.,1
I would highly recommend this kindle. It is user friendly and not to big. But large enough to see easily,1
Total crap. Batteries last for minutes.,-1
One of the best tablets on the market for its value,1
My grand baby is two years old and she absolutely loves it!,1
great deal on batteries,1
They work and the price was right. Well done Amazon,1
not long lasting move on pay more get more,-1
Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.,1
Alexa works great. It was easy to set-up and to us. My wife uses it for playing music through her iPhone and is very happy with it. I am always finding and learning new things with Alexa.,1
"Sturdy, lightweight, tops lifts for easy access to pet , easy to lean and not bulky. Carrier will easily fit on your lap in the car. A+",1
"I was a little hesitant to buy these, but they've lasted longer than Duracell and Energizers in my electronic door lock. Great value as always with Amazon products!",1
My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!,1
"I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7"" Fire better than on top like this new 8"". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.",1
This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you!,1
Getting these from now on.,1
Incredibly happy with AmazonBasics batteries.. The price is amazing and they last just as long as more expensive brands. Prime 2 day shipping has been a life saver when the kids need batteries and I don't have time to run to the store! Another great from Amazon!,1
I have always been pleased with Amazon Fire Tablets that I have brought in the past. They are fast and never have a problem connecting to the internet like a few others I have had. After trying another 1 this past year I finally decided to go to what worked best and that is the Amazon Fire. Just the best tablet I can always trust.,1
"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS.",1
"Amazon's Kindle Fire line only gets better as price gets lower. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. A sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. Some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. The Operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which I think helps it as well. Holds a charge for a good while under normal use. Am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. Absolutely will recommend Amazon Kindle FIre to anyone who will listen.",1
Love the features my new Kindle Fire has - very user friendly!,1
"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that.",1
Perfect starter item for kids learning electronics.,1
"New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all.",1
Great for learning apps and surfing internet for my 7 year old kid and also good protection,1
I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.,1
Ok.,1
I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!,1
Got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it.,1
Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.,1
Amazing!,1
So far so good as far as batteries go. I order them under subscribe and save. Makes the price even better and we always have plenty for our toddler.,1
I purchased these a little more than skeptical about how long these would actually last. But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through. So I said why not and bought them. They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and gadgets require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surpised I was with these. They come in a card board box which is was nice and easy to store. The batteries are wrapped up into groups of 4's. They hold a fairly long charge so you don't have to change them out too often.,1
My son uses the device to help him do his homework,1
This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better,1
I am pleased that my 6 year old grandson was happy with his gift,1
Got this product for a relative for christmas who had a kindle fire and was looking for an upgrade. With how far technology has grown on phones she was only looking for a reader and something that was lighter on her thumbs when reading then her kindle fire. This product was not only lighter on her thumbs but also worked great in any light.,1
I like the Amazon Tap. I use it as a speaker in my garage for working out. It is tied to my Amazon Echo. I am able to use Alexa and Amazon Prime material. Would highly recommend.,1
As good as batteries can get,1
Do not buy each have leaked within one recharge. Battery corrosion at base ruined my battery recharger as well. Warranty for 30 days. You can't use them all and recharge within 30 days,-1
"The reviews are good. It is a Xmas gift, so the person receiving it has not tried it.",1
These aa batteries are affordable and they last just as long as the leading competitors or at least in my household. It would be nice though if they offered a program where people could send their old batteries into AmazonBasics so that they can recycle them but I'm sure Amazon is in the works with that idea as we speak,1
Our 3rd Amazon fire. The battery life is outstanding. Really nice when reading a book not having to worry about the battery. Nice size.,1
"Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man's hand.",1
Purchased as a replacement for a Kindle and it functions well as a Kindle and a tablet.,1
Perfect for my grandson I love the easy to use set up and parental control. I have recommended this to my friend for her children. Case is great,1
great batteries works extremely well and we put it on our smoke detectors have to change them once a monthwill buy again,1
For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube,1
great deal,1
Wish I had opened the package all the way as soon as I received it because several of the batteries had leaked and caused corrosion on several more. Learned one this time.,0
Work great. Never found a dead one in the batch. Will definitely purchase again.,1
"I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well.",1
"It is easy to use and have a huge selection of books, I recomend it",1
Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa,1
As expected,1
"It very light, great display and very easy to use.",1
"Better loading, longer battery life, clearer picture, more space. Still just as durable!",1
Amazon Tap is exactly what I expected it would be. The sound quality is good with the Alexa features. I love that you can charge it on the base or with micro USB cord. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Amazon Echo and would like the portability.,1
Batteries...what can one say about them that wouldn't be too obvious LoL,1
This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on.,1
my dauther loves the tablet and I can get the SD to get more storage and load up all the disney movies that I purchased. it is a great purchase.,1
they seem to be good batteries very satisfied,1
"I debated between the tap and echo, and this went on sale just before Xmas for such a great price at Best Buy. That helped to make up my mind pretty quickly!",1
Easiest way to order long lasting batteries!,1
Great tablet for kids my boys love their tablets!!,1
"The setup was super easy, the rugged case is awesome, and the selection of books, games, and movies v for the kids is fantastic! The two year no questions warranty makes it even better!",1
"I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did.",1
"Let me say that this is my first Fire tablet. I've previously had either iPad's or Android tablets. I was skeptical at first because I've generally only liked iPad's, but I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.",1
"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!",1
Quick shipping - Happy with purchase,1
Die way too fast,-1
These were at a great price point didn't last anywhere near as long as I thought they would. For the little bit more I would get the Duracell or Enegizer ones.,0
I was missing a pack of 4 batteries when I opened the box today. Not impressed.,-1
Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.,1
GOOD. INEXPENSIVE. LONG LASTING WE'LL SEE.,1
"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them.",1
"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet.",1
Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!,1
"Bought these on a lightning deal....10.50 for 48 x AA batteries. We go through batteries regularly even though we have some rechargeable batteries at home. Excellent...well packaged in a box where they can be stored until needed. Amazon basic batteries last just as long as, if not longer, than other branded batteries and thus they are a staple in our home for both AA and AAA sizes.",1
Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.,1
Well worth the price.,1
batteries job well done,1
Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.,1
Love it I bought it for my mother and father she is easy for them to use and they are in there 70s,1
This product is well thoughts the kids seem to like the apps,1
work exactly as intended!,1
Nice. Great for the price.,1
Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it,1
"Great batteries, life in them seems to be pretty great so far!",1
I have used these for a while. I went thru a whole box but have not had to replace them yet in anything. Much better than the store brands at the large hardware chains.,1
"The Amazon fire HD10 is one of the best deals on the market. I've had a IPad and would rather have the HD10! It's what-1/3 of the price of a IPad and just as good, if not better",1
Bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. Great buy for the price. He loves his new tablet.,1
This tablet is a thing of beauty. The entire family loves being on it. Works great.,1
Great tablet but doesn't charge fast take a while to charge have to remove case to charge and I Brought 3 can be a hassle with kids,1
Work as great as other name brand batteries I've used.,1
"My kids loved it, they were able to learn how to use it right away",1
"This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend.",1
I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price,1
"Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it.",1
"Tablet is easy to use, however only allows 48 hours of offline viewing when movies are downloaded, then must be reset online again. This is an inconvenience. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the tablet.",1
Set up for kids right out of the box. Can't beat Amazon's warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product.,1
"I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received the batteries in the silver packaging, had no issues, long battery life, etc. The second order I received the batteries in the gray packaging as pictured. I bought the second back in April, and last week I discovered that every unused battery that I hadn't used up and thrown out was leaking. I threw out 5 batteries one day, and found 3 more that were in use in remotes that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaked, and had to throw out a remote as well since it had corroded inside.I'm not going to be buying again. I could forgive one leaking battery, but almost half the package I'll either buy another brand for a bit more money and quality, or go to a local dollar store for the same quality and less money",-1
"arrived on time, first 4 I used had short life but remainder seems to have full power",1
"Need a backup stock of AAA that you are willing to dispose of instead of keep track of and charge Amazon Basics does the job well and I have no complaints.I use these for my remote controls, gaming controllers (xb1, xb360, wiimotes), my receipting calculator, Logitech mice, etc! Pretty much whatever needs AAA batteries, this is my solution. :DCompared to the prices of of Energizer or Durcaell 12-packs, this beats those big time while meeting standards.",1
Seems to work better and last longer in our flashlights then the name brands!,1
"Seriously, these are great quality batteries at a solid price.Everyone I know gets annoyed with how much I talk about Amazon, now they hate me a little bit more when they see that I have Amazon branded batteries.It appears as those around me are simply annoyed...",1
I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!,1
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 4YR OLD. WE HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET AS IT IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. FROM WHAT I READ THIS WILL DO THE JOB FOR HIM. THE PRICE AND COLOR WAS GREAT.,1
"I decide to give it a try. And it is too early to decide how it turns out. But so far, look good.",1
"We are super happy with the kindle fire. We had bought several DVD players for our vehicle that never lasted long due to living on a dirt road, and the kindle fire was a perfect fit for replacing them. Now our almost two year old son loves the movies, shows, and games, along with the books that he can look through while we read. It also doubles as a tablet for me since it gives the options for different profiles. We love it!",1
AA they work,1
work.,1
We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.,1
bought for grand kids front camera rear camera wifi ready games they caN SKYPE SO MANY THINGS you can use it for 2 YEAR NO QUETION WARENTY its your best buy,1
"ehh...they run out of charge very quickly....its honestly bad for the environment. they do seem to be a bargain but a brand name might come in a smaller quantity but will last longer than these..update 1: these batteries pack's have 50 working(short term) and 50 non-working batteries...I brought multiple battery packs and all have batteries that don't work.In my estimation, i think these batteries are not worth it.",-1
I'll be paying extra for energizers they last longer.,0
"I replaced an old Galaxy Tab 3 with the Fire. It is taking getting used to, but I am excited to see how it works with all the Amazon Brand.",1
Perfect,1
"Works great, packaging was convenient too.",1
Good price for good batteries.,1
My 9 year old loves it. Good control options. Just need to figure out how to get the Web browser on her side.,1
Great product,1
We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.,1
I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet.,1
Great for childrens' toys! Long lasting and well priced.,1
It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.,1
"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top brands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top brands in the future. We go through a lot of the AA variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but...",0
I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile,1
Best batery,1
Great price for these we occasionally need for remotes.,1
"I keep reading how people theorize the energy usage of these batteries in comparison to the name brands. I can say that in high use devices such as flashlights, they do drain faster than Duracell. However when compared to the cost, you will still come out ahead with these, at least when buying in bulk.In addition I found that Duracell batteries gave me 4 weeks with the candles I own while Rayovac gave me 3 weeks. These Amazon batteries give me 6 weeks. So they are not only a better price but longer lasting as far as slow power drain devices.I have been using these batteries now for a great deal of time and with applicable use not pretty but utterly useless conjecture. Numbers and potential usage reports look all fine and dandy but are nothing compared to having purchased and used at least half a thousand of them. I love em. They work great in my nearly 100 electric candles.",1
I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!,1
"On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!",1
This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.,1
I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate.,1
"It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price",1
"Great sound, almost perfect interactions and portable. I have the dot and now the tap. The new update allowing voice activation is awesome. Great toy!",1
Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.,1
"I have had really good luck with buying AmazonBasics products, including these batteries. They seem to me to perform every bit as good as more expensive name brands, and the price is excellent. I will happily purchase them again in the future.",1
What a great deal!,1
"3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose.",-1
Great batteries.,1
Always a good price and good for what it's meant for.,1
"These work just as well as the name-brands, come in easy to access packaging, and are a great value! Will never buy batteries from a big box store again!",1
This tablet offers so much fun for what I expected,1
very good items!!,1
I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.,1
"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too.",-1
Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this,1
"I'm a father of two. Both of my kids (6) & (10) got iPads last year for Christmas and love them, but I felt the iPad was lacking a little of what they really need. Purchased two of these and couldn't be more happier. Perfect kids tablet. Don't make the mistake I did and go with the IPad. This product nails it in every aspect the iPad wasn't in terms of a ""kids"" tablet",1
This is my 3rd tablet the screen seems bigger in this one and I love it! I use it for all of my media internet searches and needs,1
"Great price! What can I say, besides that they work and so far haven't showed less quality from a brand name battery.",1
"I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price",1
Only a good price when on sale. I can buy the same amount at Manards for 2 less not on sale,1
This tablet is great for children. This is my daughter's second tablet. The preset apps are very usual.,1
I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.,-1
"Bought this to replace my aging Nexus 7 (2013) version, but didn't hold a candle up to it. I knew it going in, but wanted to see for myself in person. For $80, can't hardly beat the features, but I was spoiled by arguably the best small Android tablet ever made. I knew the screen resolution was lacking, especially on an 8"" screen, but coming from the Nexus, it was a huge difference. Also, even at 4 plus years old, the processor was humming along smoothly. The extra .5 gb ram was also helpful. Anyways, back to the Fire HD 8. One advantage it had over the Nexus, was the expansion slot. I loved being able to put my media on it, but then again, the media displayed on the screen was subpar, so it's a wash. I installed Google play on it, so that it expanded its functionality, and I'm an avid Amazon conneseiur, but found the table too limiting. Ultimately returned and bought an old, discontinued Fire HD 6 for $20. The resolution almost matches that of the Nexus, so I'm happy for now.",0
Spend the money and buy a name brand. These seriously do not work at all. Such a waste of money,-1
"Batteries packaged well, and are working just like any other battery",1
He loves his kindle takes it everywhere. does school work on it plus plays games Excellent piece of equipment.,1
I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.,1
Great Value!,1
it was very easy to sit up and get it to working and plying games and down loading,1
It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.,1
Made in the USA would make this a 5 star,0
"Decent batteries, I find they die a little quicker than others, but still fine for the price",1
This one was purchased for my sister. I already have one and knew she would enjoy it.,1
"Work great, just what I needed.",1
Fair price. EZ open package (thanks Amazon). seem to last. Why pay more,1
great product for the price.,1
"batteries.. everybody need them.. these are everybit as good as duracell for half the price, better than energizer .... very satisfied I use them for professional audio and photography...",1
These batteries are so strong it's like they have super powers!!!!,1
I absolutely love the parental controls on this device. You can even set a time limit on how long they can use it.,1
This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.,1
Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs.,1
I'm very happy with my purchase. I bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers.,1
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",-1
I am 100 satisfied with my purchase of these batteries,1
Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.,-1
"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it.",1
I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good,1
Good product,1
"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it.",1
"Bought this tablet for my son..great battery life, shipped fast..great value!",1
Seems to fix the faulty cable on my son's headset well.,1
"Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far.",1
good value and time will tell if they last as long as duracell,1
"Nothing much unusual or extraordinary to say here: they're batteries, and they work fine. Probably only really worth it if you either are patient about shipping, or have Prime. Otherwise, you're not missing much by getting some batteries from the grocery store or somewhere vs. these.",1
bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn't go anywhere without my kindle!,1
for an amazon battery they have actually lasted very long.,1
Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.,0
Excellent tablet for the price. We bought it as a child's tablet to surf and play games. Has tons of free apps for kids.,1
I would highly recommend this product and this seller.,1
"So far, these batteries seem to be comparable to the other major brands. Works for me!",1
Lots of batteries! :o),1
"This tablet is perfect size. Bought for my niece. We both loved the color! Only thing to complain about is there is a lot of ads? Even when you unlock the lock screen. Not sure if there is a way to turn them off? But still, great product!",1
They worked just great!!,1
They are batteries.........,1
Long lasting life,1
Got this tablet for my 1 yo baby. Easy to use and drop resistant. LOVE the cover it came with,1
"This set of batteries exploded being stored in my garage, right next to a set of duracell. Duracell is fine.",-1
I like it my son can watch his 2 favorite shows with out any problems,1
It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.,1
"Good value, Fast shipping.",1
"I love AmazonBasics products. These AAA batteries are a good example. Always good quality for a good price. We always need these AAA batteries for various flashlights, headlamps, and kitchen gear. You can't go wrong with these.Link: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack)",1
"The tablet itself works great, but be aware, this is one that comes with ads as your home screen... nowhere did it say that it had ads...",1
"These do not last long. I will stick to Kirkland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing.",0
"This is a great, easy to use tablet. It's nice because it doesn't have to be ""just a kids tablet."" I can do what I want to do on there as well. The parental controls are great. The case makes it feel pretty durable. The battery lasts a really long time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we can't get all of our apps/games on there because they're not available which is pretty disappointing. One real popular one we can't get is YouTube kids. My son loved that. He was pretty bummed about that. Overall we love the tablet, and would definitely recommend it.",1
"Its a good tablet. Fast, durable and easy to use. I especially love the parental features that are available. I am more of a fan of android tablets but for a little toodler this is far better.",1
"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.",1
Great Product excellent service,1
"I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc√©.",1
Overall great product. 5 year old can use it easily and it is great in terms of making sure young children cannot access content that is not intended for them.,1
Fine batteries for general use.,1
"Ive been buying these since they started selling them. The last batch, I had one that leaked. It was in a rather expensive candle, so a heads up for those using this battery to check once in a while. Ive never had this happen before. It turned all brown on one side and could have ruined my candle if I didnt clean it out real good. The battery was only week old, used infrequently in an air conditioned home. I will still continue to buy these.",1
"Bought as a gift, has larger screen size and memory for the same price.",1
love it great for kids my son loves it and wont put it down,1
AA batteries worked as advertised.,1
"I'm a self proclaimed bargain shopper. But at the same time I want a quality product. I make a point of reading reviews to make sure that there are some satisfied customers before I take a chance on a product. I'm happy to say that these batteries were a good choice. I have grandkids that love to play video games using remotes that use 4 batteries per controller. They go through these things like crazy. So, finding some that were affordable was necessary to keep everyone happy.",1
"purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!",1
Very trustworthy and reliable performance. Only batteries I will buy for their excellent endurance and great price,1
I have truly been converted form any other battery brand to using AmazonBasics! Very happy with the life of these batteries!,1
good buy,1
Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it,1
It's ok!!!,1
"These have worked really well. I've had these batteries for a few months, and I don't think any of the items that I have used that required batteries have died yet. Hoping the batteries continue to work for awhile longer. It is really nice have a large supply of batteries especially since these last so long!",1
"Exceeded my expectation. Easy to read, books load and store with ease ! Great for saving space for avid reader. I can travel with many books dont have to worry about space",1
They work very fine even in very cold weather.,1
"Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!",1
Bought this for my two yr old and she loves it not to mention super durable.,1
"Good price, seems to last as long as name brands I used to pay more for.",1
Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone,1
I bought this for my mother for Christmas. She is not the most technological advanced individual. She really wanted a tablet and this one works great and is super easy to use. I went to program it for her and she insisted on doing it herself. She was able to no problem!,1
Works as good as any other alkaline battery out there at a much better price. I will definitely buy again!,1
I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it.,1
I love how efficiently Amaozon packages their batteries. They seem to hold up comparably to other name brand batteries. Also they are so inexpensive!,1
Used for the led Amir motion detecting stick on lighting. Some battery batch didn't last long. The rest of the pack seems to be ok.,1
I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build .,1
My girlfriend loves using this product. She uses it every day.,1
This tablet has great graphics compared to the base android. I bought the kids protective case to use when the grandkids come over. Long battery life.,1
"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight.",-1
"I've had Amazon Kindles since v1. Each new release surpasses the one before it, as you would expect, but does so in ways that always improve the user experience. I love the feel of this one - great size, great weight, and I love the backlit screen.",1
This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.,1
"Goal: get an e- reader that allows one to read in any light situation. Goal achieved. Reading on the patio, beach is great. Easy to download books, lightweight, good battery life are all pluses",1
amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues,1
Daughter loved this as a gift. She get migraines if she were to read Ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eyes and fingers crossed no headaches,1
work great,1
Cheap batteries in bulk. What more can be said,1
Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member.,1
Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.,1
"Amazon Basic Batteries are the best, I buy them in all varieties.",1
Good reliable batteries!!,1
my kids love the kids fire they use it every single day. its durable.. I can put parental control on certain things.. great buy,1
"Price is right, but doesn't seem to hold as long of a charge as some of the other name brand batteries.",1
"These batteries are great for the price. Being as affordable as they are, I was expecting them to not last long or work well. They proved me wrong and these are honestly the best batteries I have used. I've been using them for almost 8 months now and haven't had to replace any. Granted, I don't have them in anything that uses a ton of battery power, but for the price they're worth it even lasting this long. I have them in remotes and some lights and no problems!I also love being able to buy in large packs, as then I don't have to worry about getting more batteries for a long time.It's nice to be able to stock up at a super affordable price.",1
This is a very good tablet for kids to use. You can set up time them to play game and time to read!,1
I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.,1
My grandbaby loves hers. We gave it as a Christmas present!,1
By far the greatest tablet for kids. Free time is fantastic. I don't have to worry about content for my child. And the two year worry free warranty is in heard of. 2 thumbs up,1
Great price for that many battery's they last along time,1
Cheap batteries for my TI-83 graphing calculator. Way cheaper than other brands and does what it's suppose to do.,1
Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.,1
Can't beat the price!,1
"Great deal, as good as the brand names.",1
Batteries do not last used all 48 after thanksgiving ned replacing to replace.,-1
Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around,1
"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products",0
GREEN SLIME EL CHEAPOs,1
"Seem to last , time will tell will up date later.",1
"Batteries functionlime batteries. They don't hold their charge quite as long as some of the fancier expensive brands, but dollar for dollar they take the cake",1
Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily,1
Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks.,1
Great learning apps. My 3 year old won't put it down.,1
These batteries are great and affordable! Highly recommend!,1
"Bought for my niece's 6th birthday, and it was her favorite gift. She really enjoys it.",1
Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use.,1
Great price!,1
We love this table for our 5 y.o. It gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing I can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time!,1
Batteries seem to die quickly.,0
"The batteries work great for me, I have no complaints and have had no issues.",1
Inconsistent. VERY short life.,-1
"I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!",1
Very easy to setup and use. Still learning to maximize the usage. The instructio is too simple and not cover much using Alexa .,1
This is not 39in long,1
Batteries seem to work just as well as name brand batteries but at a much cheaper price.,1
Good for the price but whatever in quality I guess...don't last too long,1
very durable and easy to work with. I love its functionality and my kid loves having his own tablet. good stuff,1
"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money.",1
Good price. They work.,1
You get what you pay for in life bht for the lrice and amount these are actually great one say or two days of strong power for flashlights or wireless headphones etc. For remotes theyblast for quite a while. Package was nice fast delivery thunking of actually buying different sizes for other electronics ...would definitly order again ...kinda like gas not premium or regular something like a plus ....lol i have tried all those other expensive brands thats supposed to last 10x more longer well by the time you pay for one pack and get maybe a months wirth depending on usage you could have a 100 of these and still have left over......just saying your not buying tires or brakes for your car so test them out they sell it in smaller amounts and subscdiption amount etc....,1
"Great batteries, just as good as Duracell if not better for a SWEEEEEEEEET price.",1
These are batteries. They work as expected and are at a great price.,1
Great entry level tablet for kids without the worries of easy breakage.,1
Wonderful value,1
"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using.",1
Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.,1
"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands‚Ä¶you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",1
Simple and clean. Love AmazonBasics,1
The only thing we don't like is that it had to stay plugged in to work.,1
"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write",1
Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.,1
I needed batteries and after having read and seen so many positive reviews I bought my first batch of Amazon Basics batteries. I was an Energizer girl and was very skeptical of trying another brand as other attempts proved unworthy. I am very pleased by the quality endurance of these batteries! I started with AAA and they worked so well that I bought AA when I needed more. The price can't be beat either! These batteries serve their purpose well and last a long time - the best bang for the buck that I have found!,1
"This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends.",1
I use this tablet often. It is the perfect size. The battery last a long time. The quality is great for the price,1
My daughter loves it. Parental controls are simple makes it easy when monitoring what my kid is in to,1
"Great deal, work perfect.",1
This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.,1
These were bought as gifts for elementary age kids. It is a great tablet which also gives the kids ability to download books to the Kindle app.,1
"I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad.",1
Great batteries at a great price,1
Worked as advertised!,1
My 3 yr old loves her new tablet and my wife and I are glad to get ours back. Very simple usage. Has all of her favorite apps on it.,1
"We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group.",1
Have used about half of these now with no issues. They seem to last as long as the name brands and in this house double AA are always needed.,1
"We have had the full-size Echo for over a year, and I love it. The Tap requires you to push the button before Alexa responds to your requests, so that takes a little getting used to after using the big Echo's voice activated requests. The Tap speaker is not as good as the big Echo, but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge. Overall, I really like this...and I found it at best buy for $78!",1
They definitely last at least 7x longer than average batteries,1
Nice size screen. Very clear picture. The blue color tablet looks very nice. Overall satisfied.,1
"Pros: Allows you to cut your cable. With many apps to download and many apps that allow you free use of services such as streaming as long as you have a Cable provided (at least for the internet), you can log in and stream. You can use apps like Kodi and TubiTV to watch many shows. My favorite is TubiTV. Yes, there are commercials but not as many as other services.Buy this, check it out, enjoy your freedom from cable TV! Cons: Don't really have any complaints.",1
Tried this out. Loved the box. The package of individuals of 4 each is nice but not convenient at times. We tried these on a high drain police radio and a low drain Samsung personal radio.STICKING WITH MAXELL. They out perform these and its noticeable for about 3 more. Better value.,-1
I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!,1
"I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too.",1
"Overall good product, bought two for my parents and they loved it!",1
"They do the job at a great price. Also purchase AA, D, 9V all the time for company.",1
Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend,1
Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.,1
"Got this for my 4 year old daughter, she enjoys playing games and reading books. A faster processor would me it better.",1
Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person,1
"Very good batteries that seem to last a lot longer than standard AAA batteries, I would assume this is due to the Japanese technology used to enable better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures. Would highly recommend at this price!",1
"I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed.",1
I absolutely love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. My kids and I can't put it down!,1
"We bought this for our 7 and 4 year old. The kids love it and it is simple to use. The ""kids"" profile makes it safe and easy to use and we can limit time of use. We can switch to our profile to watch Netflix or use other apps if we want. Comes with a great warranty and device protector. We're very happy with the Amazon Fire Tablet.",1
"Performs well, inexpensive, A++",1
"Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?",1
nice price,1
Is great for beginners I love the parental control on it it works great for my toddler.,1
"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far.",-1
"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items.",1
My kids love the tablet and it's easy for them to use,1
great deal,1
"This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't",1
Product as advertised. Arrived on time and in good condition. Good value! Will buy again.,1
We got this pad for my son who's 7. He absolutely loves it. I like the parental controls so that he reads before doing other games. Will recommend to anyone!!!,1
This tablet has been great. Although I recommend getting a memory card so you have no storage issues!,1
This was the perfect gift for my grand kids they love it.,1
Good batteries at a fair price.,1
Seems to be good batteries so far,1
The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.,1
Great batteries,1
"I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use.",1
This android tab is perfect for kids since its not that expensive,1
working great so far,1
This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies.,1
great price good quality,1
Awesome purchase. Last a pretty long time!,1
Great investment. I wouldn't rely on them in a high powered devices (even though I haven't tried them in anything other than computer mice and remote controllers) but I still have 90 of the batteries even after half a year of lying around. Great investment on batteries for when you need them.,1
"Purchased this for my fiance's youngest son for Christmas and also to replace his broken ""no name"" handheld. He loved it. The speed, ease of use and size were perfect for him. He mostly uses it for music, youtube and instagram..all of which seem to work fine on it. It was also very affordable. He's happy with it so we are too.",1
"I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting.",1
Very good quality item. A+++,1
"Has so many games for the kids to choose from, I love that I can make different profiles for each kid to limit what they play",1
"I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up.",1
Priced well and work great.,1
"Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift.",1
"I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do ‚Äì including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source.",1
"My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives.",1
Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.,1
My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!,1
Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family.,1
It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.,1
"I purchased these AmazonBasics batteries because I used a lot of batteries around the house and I was looking for the best value. I would say the convenience factor is there: I can stock up on these and I don't have to run to the store to pick up batteries. Compared to the Rayovac brand, which I have been using exclusively before purchasing these, I would say the AmazonBasics batteries give you just a bit less life. They do store well and perform well in most electronics that I've tested thus far.",1
Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.,1
"Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap.",1
Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it),1
MY children love their new Amazon Fire Tablet. Quality picture and sound.,1
"I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me!",1
Works great what more can I say. Several months in the mouse so far,1
I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids.,1
This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc.,1
"Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better.",1
Well if you are looking for cheap non-rechargeable batteries that last quite a while then these are perfect. Nothing more to say.,1
"This is the first time that I have bought Amazon batteries but the price was fantastic and we go through so many batteries with electronics,Grandchildren's toys,flashlights and numerous other items around the house.They last just as long as the best selling batteries do,nobody could tell a difference.Thank goodness I bought these before Hurricane Matthew because we lost power for days and these batteries held up very well and lasted a long time and you get so many to the box,48 total.We had mini flashlights,electric candles and large flashlights and I still have over a half of box left.I will be buying these batteries from now on and so will my daughter and sons.Very impressive!",1
Always a great product and great value. I love amazon.,1
Good batteries for the price.,1
Good batteries at a great price,1
Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use,1
great,1
Perfectly sent perfectly usable,1
I bought this for my grandson who loves it. Easy to understand and lots of great apps to download. Forget the iPad - buy this instead and get the same functionality for way less money,1
Amazon rocks. Great batteries at the click of a button lol!,1
So FAR very Good..,1
good,1
My kids have really enjoyed this tablet. This makes car rides a lot easier. They both can create and learn and they love the camera.,1
Recommend,1
The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.,0
They work well for the price,1
"Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games.",1
GREAT VALUE ....,1
Great for my kids. Syncs to all of our Amazon videos and netflix. The protective kids case is a must. Makes it easier for smaller kids to hold without touching the screen. Also does well with drops to the ground,1
do not last long at all - never by these again,-1
This speaker sound great. I was surprised at how loud it gets. The sound is clear and you also have Alexa so that's a win.,1
"This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price.",1
"Very good tablet my child enjoys it very much, the battery life is very good although he takes it for his games",1
I love kindle. Best value for money. Replacing my older model with the 8in. Like that it is expandable as I ran out of space on other one.,1
"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.",1
I've wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed.,1
Great for the price It's much more durable than anything I could get at Walmart.,1
Good item for children and is very inexpensive. Easy to hold and has a cover designed for it.,1
"It's a bunch of batteries, I have always had good luck with these batteries, All I know is you put them into the device it works",1
I love amazons batteries. Always there to save the day. I use subscribe and save to make sure my kids are never without batteries. It helps so much.,1
Bought this for my son and he loves it. And I love that he can throw it around and not break!,1
"If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!",1
"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed.",1
"easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load",1
Great speaker sound and ease of setup. Works great with Amazon music option.,1
The products that it was delivered but I could not find it anywhere,-1
We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents.,1
"Perfect for surfing web. Love the size, not too big, not too small.",1
Everything about it is outstanding except the price!,1
"Cheap AAA batteries! Haven't had any issue with them so far, I use them in stuff like... my nose hair trimmer.",1
Good quality & worth the price!! We are happy!!!!!,1
My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price.,1
I bought my daughter the kindle fire so i purchased the kindle 8 for me,1
Don't last very long but good quality for the price.,1
The batteries are good.,1
Absolutely love the product my first child had one. My second child asks for one .Now on my fourth kid and they want the same one. Nice product . And my husband do not mind getting it for the price .,1
"Is it just me, or is it a huge challenge keeping enough batteries on hand. It's easy just to order a bulk box of these rather than take a beating at retail price. I'm not sure they are up to Energizer or Duracell standards, but they do the job ok. No complaints so far.",1
"I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn't like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out.",1
This has great possibilities for the ARMCHAIR POTATO by expanding what is available to view. I would recommend this to anyone.,1
My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid!,1
"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.",0
These die a lot quicker than typical energizer and duracell batteries,-1
"I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty.",1
"great price, works very good",1
It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps,0
I am happy that the full internet option is not available on the kids free time side. My child is 4 and has a lot of fun with this tablet.,1
good value.,1
great price,1
"Bought this for my Granddaughter, she absolutely loves it!",1
"Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much.",1
A+ thanks,1
Much faster and clearer than our fire 6. Really easy to use!,1
Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you.,1
"After discarding and getting rid of broken cd cases, broken cds, and selecting those ones we really like, this binder turned up to be an excellent option to store our favourite cds and dvds and keep them in a small space at our living room, giving us the choice to donate or get rid of those cds towers that took a lot of room, despite looking nice. And because you can turn the pages, you can spot the cd you want to play without the hassle of taking it from a case that is falling apart. After storing them cds, all the cases and printed covers went straight to the recycling centre. We have a small version to put those cds my husband would like to listen to whenever he must drive away for work.",1
My grandson really enjoyed this product. Good deal.,1
I did some research on different types of tablets and this one had what I needed,1
My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.,1
"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for",1
These batteries are as good or better than any brand of alkaline battery on the market today.,1
batteries job well done,1
My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy,1
"Love the tablet not to small, lightweight, and is easy to use.",1
"The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model.",1
Purchase this tablet during the Christmas holidays on sale. Got as a gift for my job's Christmas gift party. The person who got it was very happy with it. I am familiar with the tablet because I bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her books.,1
Great tablet for the price. Got this for a present and love it,1
The batteries work great and the expiration date freshness is good.,1
Use them on my outdoor solar lights. They lasted 2 weeks and they stopped working.,0
My 5 and 8 year olds love these tablets. They are able to play age appropriate content. Tablet seems well powered and the case is providing good protection.,1
The Kindle HD 8 is very good. Has good graphics and is easy to use. Gave to sister for a gift and had to help her set it up but then she was off and running using it to play games and check her email.,1
My son already had one just upgraded. But he loves it.,1
Seem to work well will update if needed,1
"My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it's pretty good",1
I think the charging port should be something more simple since this product is aimed at smaller children. We‚Äôve only had ours for a month and the port is broke. Getting a new one sent to us.,-1
Good batteries,1
"Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet.",1
Just what I needed.,1
Great deal!,1
All around great experience!,1
"For a basic tablet, this is perfect. Good price. Does all I need it to!",1
Most of these batteries either do not have any life left to them or they are die out after one use. terrible product.,-1
"Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children.",1
"Got this for my 18 month old son so that he can watch movies on our trip to LA and he loved it. Lots of games, apps and much more. Still learning more features about this product and we love it too.",1
Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.,1
This item works great and fitst anywhere. I have no complaints...,1
Couldn't be happier with this latest Kindle e-reader! Love being able to turn pages by pushing a button and the bright uniform lighting! It's a big step up from my first generation paperweight!,1
Defective and cheap. Only a third held any charge and those died super fast.,-1
"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books.",0
The batteries work just fine. We seem to use quite a few.,1
Great buy on batteries. So far all of them have been perfect.,1
Works as described.,1
It comes in a box with prewrapped 4 packs. so worth it!,1
Great value!,1
"I like this for the size, price, expandable memory. I dont like that Im not able to get the same apps on my android phone on this but its cool for what I use it for.",1
Works as expected. Great deal on the item and have enjoyed using it.,1
These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same...,-1
"I have bought the cheaper tablets for my kids, in the past, however, the sales associate recommend this tablet, and it was only 10 dollars more. So far, I am really impressed by the difference in quality.",1
works like any another.,0
Nice!,1
These are different than the ones pictured. Are these performance ones also,0
Good batteries cheap.,1
thanks,1
My husband was recently diagnosed with Encephalitis and needs to regain his memory. He loves doing crosswords on his tablet,1
We have had great luck with Amazon brand batteries and feel no need to pay big box brand name prices. We also loved being able to have them shipped to us.,1
Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it,1
Works just as good as other name brand batteries. I can't speak for longevity as these are used in devices that either gets used a lot or sometimes not for a week at a time. So far I would buy again.,1
My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She,1
"This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use.",1
"After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet.",1
very good,1
This tablet is easy to use and great for a new user.,1
Great product. Great price. Packaged well.,1
Pretty sure they didn't really have a charge when they arrived,-1
My kid loves it and is easy to use.Plus the case is worth it.,1

Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.,1
Amazon's in house brand of batteries are not bad at all.,1
You can't beat a great price on a ton of batteries. They are holding up like the name brands so far. I love Amazon basics. I just love everything Amazon really!,1
"I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price.",1
